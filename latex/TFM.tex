\chapter{Introduction and motivation}
In \an nuclear reactions, an alpha particle ($^4_2\text{He}^{2+}$) hits a target nucleus ($^\text{A}_\text{Z}\text{X}$) and a neutron is ejected.
Generally, in the laboratory frame of reference, the $\alpha$ is fast-moving and the target is stationary.
The produced neutron will also be fast, and the resulting nucleus ($^{\text{A}+3}_{\text{Z}+2}\text{Y}$) will be of a new element and have a small recoil.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{anreaction.png}
	\caption{Illustration of an \an reaction.}
	\label{anreaction}
\end{figure}

Underground experiments trying to detect dark matter WIMPs or other rare events have to deal with neutron backgrounds that are hard to distinguish from the desired particles.
The main contribution to this background comes from \an reactions, produced by alphas coming from the radioactive decay of elements in the ground.\cite{neutron_in_an}.	%TBD:citas más relevantes, ésta lo da por sabido

A good knowledge of the cross-section and neutron spectra of these reactions is thus useful to differentiate between background counts and rare events.
\\

·Actual state of \an measurements.\\

·The objective of the measurements at CNA are to check the viability for carrying out more \an measurements.\\


\chapter{Experimental setup}
The source of alphas for the experiment is the \qty{3}{\mega\volt} tandem accelerator at CNA, which fires alphas at a \Aliso target.
Detectors used are both organic and inorganic scintillators.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{overview_photo.jpg}
	\caption{Overview picture of the experimental setup.
	Detectors and the target are labeled.}
	\label{overview_photo}
\end{figure}

During the measurements, the particle accelerator fires $\alpha$ particles at the target, which is thick enough to stop all of them.
The \an reactions are observed by a series of radiation detectors placed around the target, at different distances and angles.
They are all connected to a data acquisition system (DAQ), that records everything for later analysis.
The current hitting the target also monitored, by a charge integrator also connected to the DAQ.

\section{Tandem 3MV accelerator}
A tandem is a type of linear particle accelerator whose main characteristic is that particles are accelerated twice by the same terminal voltage.
Particles are injected with negative charge from a source situated outside the tank, and accelerated toward the terminal.

Once the negatively charged particles arrive a the terminal, their electrons are removed by a gas, called the \textit{stripper}.
Now with a positive charge, they are accelerated the rest of the way by the same voltage.
\\

In the case of alpha particles, they are injected with charge -1, and then stripped of all electrons, to charge +2.
Given that the maximum voltage of the CNA tandem accelerator is \qty{3}{\mega\volt}, alphas can be accelerated to a theoretical maximum of $3\cdot\left(1+2\right) = \qty{9}{\mega\eV}$.	%TBD:añadir injection energy
\\

\subsection{Pulsed beam mode}
For most applications, the accelerator generates a continuous stream of particles.
But it can also be operated in a \textit{pulsed beam} manner, where particles are emitted in groups, or \textit{pulses}.

Ideally, those pulses are instantaneous: all particles arrive at exactly the same time.
In reality, they are approximated by a gaussian distribution, with a certain width in the order of a few nanoseconds.	%TBD: anchura exacta?
\\

To achieve pulsed operations, the accelerator uses two devices: the \textit{chopper} and the \textit{buncher}.
The \textit{chopper} generates an electric field that deflects all particles coming from the accelerator.
With a X frequency, it disengages the field and lets particles pass for 40 to \qty{250}{\nano\second}.	%TBD: poner valores

After the chopper, the \textit{buncher} uses further electric fields to slow down the faster particles and accelerate the slower ones, making the pulse narrower in time (1 to \qty{2}{\nano\second}) and gaussian shaped.	%TBD:poner valor
\\

\subsection{Difficulties with accelerating alpha particles}	%TBD:replace with bold symbol
Although it is used in this experiment to accelerate alphas, the CNA Tandem accelerator was not designed with them in mind.
Rather, it was designed to accelerate deuterons, which have the same mass-to-charge ratio.
This means that, while alphas can be also be accelerated, some problems arise when generating pulses.

The reason is that the electric fields used by the buncher to shape pulses are not strong enough for alphas.
This produces both wider and asymmetric pulses than with deuterons, as well as smaller overall currents; especially at higher energies (Figure \ref{uneven_gflash}).
In practive, it limits the energy that can be achived for $\alpha$ particles with the accelerator in pulsed mode, to around \qty{8.5}{\MeV}.
\\

\subsection{Neutron line}
After the particles are accelerated, they pass through the neutron line before hitting the target.

It is placed after the accelerator's \qty{90}{\degree} analyzing magnet, typically used to deflect particles toward the other experimental lines.
Because the neutron line is parallel to the accelerator, we cannot use the magnet to select particles (discard particles that do not have the desired charge state/speed ratio).
This is not a problem in our case, as the amount of alphas with charge +1 (not all electrons are stripped by the \textit{stripper}) is negligible.

Figure \ref{tandemdiagrama} shows all of the valves, collimators, filters, etc... placed along the line.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{tandemdiagrama.eps}
	\caption{Diagram of the accelerator system and HiSPANoS neutron line, with all components.
	The detectors shown do not correspond to the angles they were placed in.}
	\label{tandemdiagrama}
\end{figure}

\section{Target}
The target is a sheet of \qty{95}{\percent} purity \Aliso.
Being a few milimeters thick, it is enough to be considered a thick target, meaning it will stop all incoming $\alpha$ particles.
\\
%Because the target is thick (more than a few micrometers), all of the alphas will be completely stopped by it.
%This means that, for some of the \an reactions, the alpha particles will have lost part of their energy in the material.

%Any measurements taken with a thick target are thus integrated measurements, for energies up to the one the alphas were accelerated to.
%If we wanted to measure only \an reactions at a specific energy, we would have to use a very thin sheet of aluminium, so as to stop the alphas from being slowed down.
%\\

It is important, in order to obtain quantitative results, to know how many alphas hit the target.
Because they are stripped of all their electrons, they have charge +2 when they arrive at the target.\footnote{Because the neutron line is aligned with the accelerator, using the \qty{90}{\degree} electromagnet to eliminate other charge states is not possible. Nontheless, the number of alpha particles with charge +1 is considered small enough as to be ignored.}
The target is isolated from the rest of the neutron line by insulators (Figure \ref{tandemdiagrama}), and so it charges up positively as alphas impact it.
By measuring the charge on the target, we can know how many alphas have hit it.

To do so, we connect the target via a cable to a \emph{charge integrator}, a device that emits a pulse and discharges the target each time it reaches \qty{0.1}{\nano\coulomb}, or approximately \num{3E8} alphas.
It is important that the target does not accumulate too much positive charge, as that could slow down or deflect incoming particles.

\end{figure}

\section{Radiation detectors}
The thick target yield (number of \an reactions per number of incident alphas) will be measured by using gamma detectors, while the \an neutron spectra will be done via time of flight measurements with a neutron detector.
\\

\label{distances_angles_table}
\end{table}

\subsection{LaBr}
To measure $\gamma$-rays, we use two LaBr\textsubscript{3} (lanthanum bromide) detectors, which we refer to as "LaBr1" and "LaBr2".
They are inorganic scitillators, meaning they produce light when hit by ionizing radiation.
This can be used to detect gamma rays by the following process:

When a gamma ray hits the material, it gives all of its energy via the photoelectric effect, or part of it through Compton scattering; to an electron in the medium.
This electron travels the scintillator, losing energy by exciting atoms.
When those excited states decay, they emit a \textit{scintillating} light, to which the material is transparent.

This \textit{scintillating} light is directed to a photocathode, where it emits electrons via the photoelectric effect.
These \textit{photo-electrons} are multiplied in a \textit{photomultiplier tube} (PMT), and finally turned into an electric pulse, which is registered as a detection.

Because proportionality is maintained in each of those conversions, we get a spectroscopic response, where more energetic gammas generate proportionately bigger pulses.
\\

To calculate the detectors' efficiency to \qty{511}{\keV} gammas, we use a \Na source that we tape to the target, at the end of the neutron line.
This is pictured in Figure \ref{target_photo}.
By fitting the resulting peak to a gaussian, we get the number of detected photons per second.
We then divide by the total number of emmited photons (given the source's activity) to get the efficiency.
\begin{equation}
	\text{detector efficiency} = \frac{\text{counts per second}-\text{background}}{\text{total source emissions}}
\end{equation}

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{labr_na22_calibration.png}

	\caption{LaBr1 response to \textsuperscript{60}Co calibration source.}
	\label{labr_co60_calibration}
\end{figure}

They are placed close to the target, in order to get as many counts as possible; and behind it, so as not to be in front of the other detectors.

\subsection{MONSTER}
To measure the time of flight of neutrons produced by \an reactions, we use MONSTER, a liquid organic scintillator.
Two smaller, liquid organic TADEO scintillators were also used, but their data has not been analyzed due to their poorer efficiency.
\\

Their operating principle is the similar to that of inorganic scintillators described before, except that the excited stated that emit the \textit{scintillating} light are molecular in nature, not atomic.
Organic scintillators have a higher efficiency when for detecting neutrons than inorganic ones, as neutrons excite the material mostly through $\left( \text{n},\text{p}  \right)$ reactions (unlike gamma rays), which have a higher cross-section with hydrogen atoms.

Because the molecules are being excited by different charged particles, different states are populated and scintillating light is emmited with longer half-lifes.
This means that the resulting electric pulse is wider, which allow us to differentiate between pulses caused by photons and those caused by neutrons.
This is called \textit{pulse shape discrimination}, or PSD.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{psd_explanation.png}
	\caption{Illustration of scintillation pulses generated by two different radiation types.}	%TBD:mejor calidad, buscar fuente
	\label{psd_explanation}
\end{figure}

By integrating the charge in a scintillation pulse in two parts, between the initial \textit{fast} rise and the latter \textit{slow} tail, we can calculate a number, PSD:
\begin{equation}
	\text{PSD} = \frac{\text{slow}}{\text{fast}+\text{slow}}	%TBD:check
\end{equation}
that we can use to separate counts corresponding to neutrons from those that correspond to gammas.
At high energies, the \textit{fast} portion saturates, causing the shape of the gamma tail seen in Figure \ref{example_psd}.
This saturation can be caused by a voltage limit either in the detector or in the software in the data acquisition system.

	\caption{2D histogram showing PSD separation between neutrons and gamma rays for a MONSTER measurement.
	The separation line between the two is ahown in black and dotted.}
	\label{example_psd}
\end{figure}

MONSTER's response to photons is different than the lanthanum bromide detectors.
Because it is organic, the cross-section for the photoelectric effect is much smaller; and so photopeaks are not visible, only the Compton continuum is.

To calibrate the MONSTER detector in energy, we use an efficiency curve obtained from simulations, shown in Figure \ref{monster_efficiency}.	%TBD: referencia?

\end{figure}

\section{DAQ}
All of the data from the detectors, as well as from the charge integrator, are connected to a \textit{data acquisition system}, or DAQ.
The one used consists of a single digitizer, a card that takes all of the incoming signals and saves the timestamp, energy and psd components (for neutron detectors), among other data, of every count.
The data from each measurement is saved in separate \textit{.root} files in the computer it is connected to, to be later analyzed by ROOT.

\chapter{Neutron emission Thick Target Yield (TTY) by activation}

\section{Activation experiments}

\subsection{The activation principle}
\textit{Activation} measurements are a way of measuring the yield of a reaction in a material by measuring the decay of a resulting isotope.
For \an measurements, the beam is operated in continuous mode, launching towards the target a stream of alpha particles of a certain energy, $E_\alpha$.
When the particles hit the target, there is a certain probability \an reactions (among others) occur.
Because the target is thick enough that all alphas will be stopped, these reaction will take place at any alpha energy between $E_\alpha$ and, as the particles lose energy in the target, the reaction threshol of \qty{3}{\MeV}.

The number of \an reactions will be proportional to the number of incident alpha particles, and the proportionality constant is the \textbf{thick target yield}.
This is different from the regular \textit{yield}, which considers reactions at a single energy.
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{\text{number of \an reactions}}{\text{number of incident alphas}}
	\label{tty_def}
\end{equation}

In \textit{activation} measurements, the number of \an reactions will be determined from the number of reaction product nuclei, by measuring their decay radiation.
For this, the reaction must produce an isotope that decays with an appropriately long half-life (not too long nor too short), and emitting radiation that we can easily detect.

Ideally, the target is to be bombarded for a period of at least a few half-lifes, and then left to decay for several more, while we measure the decay radiation.

\subsection{\Aliso\an activation at CNA HiSPANoS}
At the HiSPANoS, we have used a thick \Aliso target with \qty{95}{\percent} purity.
Each \an reaction creates a single \Piso nuclei, which is a radioactive isotope with a \qty{2.498(4)}{\minute} half-life.
We measure its $\beta +$ decay into \textsuperscript{30}Si by observing the \qty{511}{\keV} annihilation $\gamma$-rays, emmited with an intensity of \num{1.99710(8)} \cite{nucleardatasheets}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Piso_decay_scheme.png}
	\caption{\Piso decay scheme.
	From \cite{nucleardatasheets}.}
	\label{Piso_decay_scheme}
\end{figure}

We irradiate the \Aliso target for several (3 to 6) half-lifes, and then let the produced \Piso decay for about 6 half-lives, so its activity becomes negligible.
During the irradiation, the number of alphas hitting the target is being measured by connecting a cable from the target to the current integrator, and then sent to the DAQ (setup pictured in Figure \ref{target_photo}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_activation_energy_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum.
	The energy window used to generate the time histogram (Figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}) is shown in red.}	%TBD: calibrar en energía o poner "canales"
	\label{example_activation_energy_histogram}
\end{figure}

To measure the decay of \Piso nuclei, we use the two LaBr\textsubscript{3} scintillators and look at the $\gamma$-rays emitted from the target.
Figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram} shows the energy deposited spectrum of one of the LaBr\textsubscript{3} detectors during an activation measurement.
The reason there are two peaks, instead of the single \qty{511}{\keV} peak we would expect, is that the high rate of counts during activation affects the gain of the detectors, shifting the channel the peak corresponds to.
This is illustrated in Figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}, corresponding to an irradiation between 360 and \qty{820}{\s}.
To represent the counting rate as a function of time that allows studying the decay of \Piso, displayed in Figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}), we take only the counts whose energy fall inside the energy window shown in Figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_activation_energytime.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum over time.	%TBD: calibrar en energía o poner "canales"

	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_activation_time_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation time histogram.
	The activation and decay periods are labeled and separated from the rest of the histogram by red lines.
	The approximate size of the \textit{extra background} caused by the alpha stream is also shown.}
	\label{example_activation_time_histogram}
\end{figure}

The time distribution shown in Figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram} shows initial counts before the activation starts, corresponding to decay of \Piso from the previous irradiation.
When the activation starts, \num{\approx 11000} counts per bin appear very quickly, going away as soon as the irradiation ends.
We call these counts the \textit{extra background}.
They are proportional to the beam current and correspond to $\gamma$-rays from \an and other reactions.

They can also be seen in Figure \ref{example_activation_energytime} as the large number of counts appearing during activation well outside of the \qty{511}{\keV} peak.
They affect the time distribution because, even if the emitted $\gamma$-rays are outside of the selected energy window, their Compton continuum may still fall inside.

After irradiation, the counts correspond to the decay of the created \Piso nuclei.

\subsection{Measurements}
The \Aliso\an activation measurements were carried out in two sessions of two consecutive days, in February and April.
Table \ref{activation_measurements_table} summarises the different measurement conditions.

Because detectors were unmounted in between both sessions, calibration measurements with \Na to determine the detector efficiency were done once for each month.

\end{table}

\section{Data analysis}
We can determine the activity from \Piso nuclei in the target using the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
	A(t) = \ddt{N(t)} = P(t) -\lambda N(t)
	\label{activation_diffeq}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant of \Piso, $N(t)$ is the number of \Piso at time $t$, and $P(t)$ is the \Piso production rate.
The Thick Target Yield of the reaction (TTY) can then be calculated from the production rate and the beam current:
\begin{equation}
	\text{TTY} = \frac{P(t)}{I_\alpha(t)}
\end{equation}
\\
%or, for an activation of duration $\Delta t$:
%\begin{equation}
%	\int_{\Delta t}P(t) \dif t = \text{total \an reactions} = \text{thick target yield} \cdot \text{total incident alphas}
%\end{equation}
%and thus:
%\begin{equation}
%	\text{thick target yield} =
%	\frac{P(t)}{\text{incident alphas per unit of time}} =
%	\frac{\int_{\Delta t}P(t) \dif t}{\text{total incident alphas}}
%	\label{tty_fromP}
%\end{equation}

Our goal being to get the thick target yield from $P(t)$, what we will actually analyze is the activity of \Piso nuclei as they decay by $\beta +$, which will be $A(t) = \lambda N(t)$.
In order to do that, we use the two LaBr\textsubscript{3} scintillators to detect \qty{511}{\keV} $\gamma$-rays.
Some counts will be background, corresponding not to \Piso decays, but to the Compton continuum of higher energy emissions either in the environment or due to other reactions caused by the alphas in the target.
In order to get the activity in decays per second, we must subtract the background $b(t)$ from the \qty{511}{\keV} counts $c(t)$ shown and then divide by the intensity of the mission ($I_{511}=\num{1.99}$), the histogram binwidth ($b_{\Delta t}$) and the detection efficiency ($\varepsilon_{511}$):
\begin{equation}
	A = \text{\Piso decays per second} = \frac{\text{\qty{511}{\keV} counts per bin}}{\text{binwidth in seconds}\cdot\num{1.99}} - \text{background}
\end{equation}
We use three different methods to get $P(t)$, depending on wether $P(t)$ is considered constant during the activation period or not; and on the part of the histogram being looked at.

\subsection{Decay fit}
After the activation period is over, we are left with a certain number of \Piso nuclei that will decay following a radioactive decay law.
For the \textit{decay} fit, we simply fit this part of the activation histogram to a negative exponential, $A(t) = A\textsubscript{EOA} e^{-\lambda t} + B$ to get the \Piso activity at the end of activation, $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.

The fit also considers a constant background $B$, coming from the environment.

It is implemented using the ROOT \textit{fit} method, with $A$\textsubscript{EOA}, $\lambda$ and $B$ as fit parameters.
The value of the decay constant $\lambda$ is fixed to that of \Piso, and not determined by the fit.
However, it can be unfixed so that ROOT calculates its value, both to make sure that no other isotope is being produced at significant quantities, and as a sanity check.
Because that test was successful, the parameter is fixed to the known value of $\lambda$ and following fits only return two values: the constant background $B$, and the initial activity $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.
\\

We then divide $A$\textsubscript{EOA} by $\lambda$ to get the number of \Piso nuclei at the end of activation, $N$\textsubscript{EOA}.
However $N$\textsubscript{EOA} is not the number of \Piso nuclei created by \an reactions, as some will have decayed during the activation period.
\[ \frac{A_\text{EOA}}{\lambda} = N_\text{EOA} \neq \int_{\Delta t}P(t) \dif t \]

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_decay_fit.png}
	\caption{Example decay fit.}
	\label{example_decay_fit}
\end{figure}

We can solve the differential equation \ref{activation_diffeq} during the activation period analytically by taking $P(t)$ as a constant, $P$.
We get
\begin{equation}
	\ddt{N} = P -\lambda N
\end{equation}
and its solution is:
\begin{equation}
	N(t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} + \left(  N_0 - \frac{P}{\lambda}  \right) e^{-\lambda t}
	\label{activation_constantP_solution}
\end{equation}
with $N_0$ the initial number of \Piso nuclei, assumed to be \num{0}.
As $t\longrightarrow\inf$, $N(t)\longrightarrow P/\lambda$, meaning production equals decay.
This effect is called \textit{saturation}, and means that, for long enough activations, one can simply take $A_\text{EOA}\approx P$.
If that approximation cannot be made (which is our case), then $N$\textsubscript{EOA} will be equal to:
\[ N\textsubscript{EOA} =N(\Delta t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} - \frac{P}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda \Delta t} = \frac{P}{\lambda} \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)\Longrightarrow A\textsubscript{EOA}=P\left(1-e^{-\lambda\Delta t}\right)\Longrightarrow \]
\begin{equation}
	P = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ the total activation time.
$P\cdot\Delta t$ is the total number of \Piso nuclei created during the activation, meaning we can now get the thick target yield, according to equation \ref{tty_fromP}, as:
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{P\cdot \Delta t}{\text{total incident alphas}} = \frac{A_\text{EOA}\cdot \Delta t}{\text{total incident alphas} \cdot \left( 1-e^{-\lambda \Delta t}  \right)}
\end{equation}

All that is left is to correct for the efficiency of the detector, and the final formula for the thick target yield is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{A_\text{EOA}\cdot\Delta t}{\text{total incident alphas} \cdot \text{detector efficiency} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)}	%TBD? use symbols instead?
\end{equation}
\\

The advantages of this method are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The fitting is simple and fast.
	\item Only the total number of incident alphas is needed, not information of current over time.
	\item The \textit{extra background} doesn't bother us, as we only care about the counts once activation ends.
	\item It is the standard way to carry out activation measurements.
\end{itemize}
The main disadvantage is that, because it assumes $P(t)$ to be constant, the method won't work if the alpha current is not approximately constant over time.

\subsection{Unified and rise fit}
Instead of taking $P(t)$ as constant and integrating \ref{activation_diffeq} analitically, another option is to fit either the whole histogram or the activation period (\textit{unified} or \textit{rise} fits, respectively) to a function that numerically integrates equation \ref{activation_diffeq} step by step.

The function takes the data of current over time as input, and calculates $P(t)$ every step as $P(t) = \text{thick target yield}\cdot\text{alphas}$, with 'alphas' the number of incident alphas during the step.
This is useful because the current is not perfectly constant, there are drops and rises in many of the measurements (Figure \ref{current_histograms}) and this could make the \textit{decay} fit less precise, as the assumption of constant current could be incorrect.
\\
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{current_histograms.png}
	\caption{All current histograms, superimposed.
	The one in red corresponds to measurement 4.}
	\label{current_histograms}
\end{figure}

The function is implemented using a C++ functor, and the fitting using ROOT's \textit{fit} method.
Every step, it calculates $P(t)=\text{thick target yield}\cdot\text{alphas}$, then assumes $P$ constant for the duration of the step.
It sets the new number of \Piso nuclei as:
\begin{equation}
	N(t+\dif t)=\frac{P}{\lambda} + \left( N(t)-\frac{P}{\lambda} \right) e^{-\lambda \dif t}
\end{equation}
then repeats until the end of the data.
This numerically integrates equation \ref{activation_diffeq} using the analytical solution \ref{activation_constantP_solution}.
It outputs the counts over time ($1.99 \lambda N$) every step, so that ROOT can compare it to the histogram of \qty{511}{\keV} counts over time for fitting.
The thick target yield is one of the parameters adjusted by the fitting (it is used to calculate $P$), and so it is outputted by ROOT directly and only the binwidth of the histogram needs to be acounted for.

This function also considers a constant background (adding it to its output), an initial number of \Piso (from previous activation runs); and a number of counts proportional to the current (also added to its output), which correspond to the \textit{extra background}.
All of those are also parameters for the fitting, and also adjusted by ROOT.
\\

The thick target yield, corrected by the detector efficiency, in units of \an per alpha, is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{\text{result of the fitting}}{\text{detector efficiency}}
\end{equation}
with \num{1.99} the intensity of the \qty{511}{\keV} decay radiation, which we need to divide by because the histograms involved are in counts, not \Piso decays.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_unified_fit.png}
	\caption{Example unified fit (red) and data (blue).}
	\label{example_unified_fit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_rise_fit.png}
	\caption{Example rise fit (red) and data (blue).}
	\label{example_rise_fit}
\end{figure}

Figures \ref{example_unified_fit} and \ref{example_rise_fit} show the fits (red) to the data (blue).
We can see that they adjust very well.
In Figure \ref{example_unified_fit}, we can see that it also correctly accounts for an initial amount of \Piso from a previous activation, as well as the \textit{rise} and \textit{decay} periods.
\\

Data of current over time was not recorded in half of the measurements in April (numbers 8, 9 and 10).	%TBD: por qué razón?
In addition, measurement number 4, in February, shows loss of data due to a problem with the DAQ.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{activation_4_time.png}
	\caption{Activation measurement number 4.
	We can see the loss of signal to the DAQ periodically for most of the activation period.}
	\label{activation_4_time}
\end{figure}

These problems prevent the \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits from being used for all measurements.
\\

\section{Results}
Because all measurements were carried out with two detectors, we can start by comparing them.
Afterwards, we can compare the different methods with each other, to find out wether they agree.
Then, we can compare the final results with data from EXFOR.

\subsection{Agreement between detectors}
In theory, both detectors should give the exact same result.
Figure \ref{decay_errors_rel_per} shows that the relative difference in measurements between LaBr detectors 1 and 2 is around \qty{4}{\percent} for February and \qty{8}{\percent} for April.
The points shown are for \textit{decay} fit measurements only (for the sake of brevity), but are similar for the other methods.
The percentage is calculated as the difference between LaBr 1 and the mean, over the mean of both detectors: $\frac{\text{LaBr}_1-\text{mean}}{\text{mean}}\cdot 100 = \frac{\text{LaBr}_1-\text{LaBr}_2}{\text{LaBr}_1+\text{LaBr}_2}\cdot 100$.
This is so that it roughly corresponds to the uncertainty of the mean.

Measurements in February show negative values, indicating detector 2 is higher; while those in April are positive, meaning the opposite is true.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{decay_errors_rel_per.eps}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between detectors in each measurement.
	The number shown is calculated as $\frac{\text{LaBr}_1-\text{LaBr}_2}{\text{LaBr}_1+\text{LaBr}_2}\cdot 100$, the difference over the average, in percentage.}
	\label{decay_errors_rel_per}
\end{figure}

The outlier, with \qty{-30}{\percent}, corresponds to measurement number 6.
For this measurement, LaBr detector number 1 was placed much closer to the target, and at \qty{0}{\degree}.
The corresponding \Na calibration measurement does not correspond to that configuration, and so the results from this measurement and detector are unreliable.
The measurements \emph{before} the change in position can also not be trusted, as the calibration was done on the 18th, after the position was changed back; and the distances and angles were not carefully measured.

Going forward, measurements 5 and 6 will be discarded, and their results not shown.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{decay_errors_rel_per_fixed.eps}
	\caption{Same as Figure \ref{decay_errors_rel_per}, but without measurements 5 and 6.}
	\label{decay_errors_rel_per_fixed}
\end{figure}

The best agreements between detectors are for the measurements at higher energies, in both months.
The differences barely changing at energies under \qty{8}{\MeV}, and we can see at \qty{8.5}{\MeV}, where we have two measurements, that they give very similar numbers.
All of this tells us that this difference is due to a systemic error, and that it is likely dependent on the energy of the accelerator.

Regardless, agreement between detectors is good and consistent, and going forward we will represent, for each measurement and method, the average between both detectors.
Their error bars will be $\pm$ the relative differences calculated above.

\subsection{Agreement between fit methods}
To determine the agreement between the different fit methods, we can calculate the relative difference between the results given by each, with the same formula as in the previous point.
In Figure \ref{activation_method_comparison} are represented the relative difference when comparing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Unified} with \textit{rise}, drawn with crosses.
	\item \textit{Unified} with \textit{decay}, drawn with Xs.
	\item \textit{Decay} with the average between \textit{rise} and \textit{unified}, drawn with squares.
		This one is to compare the most conventional way of doing activation measurements with the more numerial method.
\end{itemize}
Because we have already discarded measurements 5 and 6 completely, and we don't have current data (and thus \textit{rise} and \textit{unified} results) for mesurements 4, 8, 9, and 10; we only have 4 measurements to do this comparison with.
Luckily, they are each at a different alpha energy.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{activation_method_comparison.eps}
	\caption{Relative difference between the different fitting methods, with different symbols for each comparison; and color for each month.}
	\label{activation_method_comparison}
\end{figure}

We can see that the agreement is under \qty{9}{\percent} between \textit{unified} and \textit{rise}, and under \qty{1}{\percent} between \textit{unified} and \textit{decay}, for all measurements.
It seems from the results that the \textit{rise} method is the one in most disagreement with the others.
The difference between \textit{decay} and the average between \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} is thus mostly due to the \textit{rise} results being more discordant.

This disagreement with \textit{rise} seems to correlate with the current being less constant for measurements 1 and 3 (energies \num{5.5} and \num{8.5} in Figure \ref{activation_method_comparison}) and, more noticeably, having abrupt changes compared to measurements 2 and 7.
More measurements are needed to make sure, but a sudden change in current mostly means a change in the \textit{extra background}.
It makes sense that the results are worse, as \textit{unified} is able to give a better fit for the proportionality constant that determines the \textit{extra background}, by virtue of also analyzing the sudden change at the beginning and end of activation.
\\

We will, then, discard the \textit{rise} results and use only the \textit{decay} results moving forward.
Representing the \textit{decay-unified} average would restrict us to only 4 measurements, so we will represent \textit{decay} results for all 8\footnote{Measurements 5 and 6 were removed.}, knowing they agree within \qty{1}{\percent}.

\subsection{Disagreement with EXFOR data}
When comparing the results we have obtained with EXFOR data, the disagreement is very large, around a factor of \num{1.9}.
In Figure \ref{activation_final_results}, we plot the absolute results for the thick target yield, along with the raw data from EXFOR.
We also plot the EXFOR data scale up by \num{1.9}, to show that the results follow the same shape, but higher.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{activation_final_results.eps}
	\caption{Final results for thick target yield, next to the data from EXFOR and a scaled up version.}
	\label{activation_final_results}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{activation_result_diffs} shows the ratio of results over EXFOR.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{activation_result_diffs.eps}
	\caption{Relative difference of different methods with respect to EXFOR data.
	\qty{+100}{\percent} difference means the result is double the expected.}
	\label{activation_result_diffs}
\end{figure}

We can see that the results are almost double the expected, and also that they deviate more for energies higher than \qty{7}{\MeV}; meaning their shape is also not completely the same (although the difference is small), the curve grows somewhat faster.
The lower point at \qty{8.5}{\MeV} corresponds to measurement 4, done on February but on the second day, unlike the others.
The difficulties with the Tandem at higher energies might explain the diverging results there.
For measurement 4 specifically, some other change from one day to the next might be a possible explanation for it decreasing instead of increasing, the same way measurements change from February to April.

We can compare the results by month and see that, for April, they are consistently higher than for February, but not by much.
For the two energies where we can compare \textit{decay} results, the difference is of \qty{2.8}{\percent} for \qty{5.5}{\MeV} and \qty{3.0}{\percent} for \qty{7.0}{\MeV} (compared to their average).
\\

In conclusion, although the activation measurements are consistent with each other and their shape is consistent with EXFOR; they are all too high, multiplied by a factor of around \num{1.9}.
This is most likely due to an unidentified error in the data analysis, whose cause remains a mistery.
Other possible causes, like errors in the measurement process, are not consistent with the results being in accord with each other so well.
The error must also, by necessity, affect all methods employed to arrive at the results equally; which remove the possiblity of it being specific to any one fitting method.

In the end, it could not be found.

\chapter{Measuring neutron energy by time-of-flight}

\section{The time-of-flight experiments}
The most accurate, and sometimes the only, method for determining the kinetic energy energy of a neutron is by time-of-flight.

\subsection{The time-of-flight principle} 
This method requires that the beam of particles producing the neutrons features a pulsed beam structure: the alphas should arrive in narrow pulses spaced with a certain period, producing as a results neutrons also in the form of pulses.
\\

The time that the radiation needs to reach the detector since it is produced is called the \textit{time-of-flight}, or ToF.
In the case of $\gamma$-rays, they move at the speed of light $c$, and thus all arrive at the detector at $\text{ToF}=L/c$, with $L$ the distance to the target, forming the so-called  \textit{gamma flash}.
Neutrons, however, have different speeds depending on their kinetic energy and therefore arrive at the detector with a ToF distribution from which the neutron energy distribution produced by the \an reaction can be extracted.
For each neutron:
\begin{equation}
	E_n=\frac{1}{2} m_n \left( \frac{L}{\text{ToF}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_n \left( \frac{L}{t_n - t_{flash} + L/c} \right)^2
	\label{Eq_ToF2En}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the distance between the target and the detector, and where the ToF of the neutrons is calculated in reference to the time of the $\gamma$-flash $t_{flash}$ and of the neutron $t_n$ in reference to some other point in time.

The neutron energy resolution that can be achieved can be calculated through propagation of errors as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta E_n}{E_n} =
    2\sqrt{\frac{c^6\left(t_n-t_\text{flash}\right)^2\left(t_n-t_\text{flash}+\frac{L}{c}\right)^4}{\left(c\left(t_n+t_\text{flash}\right)+L\right)^6}\left(\frac{\Delta L}{L}\right)^2 + \frac{\Delta t_n^2 + \Delta t_\text{flash}^2}{{\left(\frac{L}{c}+t_n-t_\text{flash}\right)}^2}}
    \label{Eq_Enresolution}
\end{equation}

Hence, the resolution is better as the detector is placed further from the target (approximately, $\Delta E_n/E_n \propto L^{-2}$) and as the beam pulses become narrower (as this is it what causes  $\Delta$t$_{flash}$, the fact the alphas do not arrive all at the same time).
The beam pulses always have a certain width that generally can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution.

In order to study the time structure of the beam pulse, the shape of the observed $\gamma$-flash is a good proxy, because the photons travel all at the same speed and are directly caused by the alphas in the beam.
The gamma-flash will thus have the same shape as the alpha pulse, simply scaled by a factor and with an added background from other sources.

\subsection{Time-of-flight implementation at HiSPANoS} 
In order to measure the ToF distribution, each time the accelerator's chopper acts, its internal clock emits an electric signal that is sent through a long cable to the DAQ, which takes it as a reference signal, from wich to determine $t_{flash}$ and $t_n$.
It doesn't correspond to when the pulse arrives at the target, as the time the particles take to cover the distance is not the same as the time taken by the electric signal to travel along the cable and be registered.

The detector signals from photons and neutrons are registered and marked with the timestamp relative to the chopper clock.
The result is a ToF distribution of signals that, in order to have physical meaning, need just to be shifted so that the $\gamma$-flash falls in the $\text{ToF}=L/c$ position.
\\

An example of the observed $\gamma$-flash is displayed in Figure \ref{example_gflash}.	%YO ENSEñARÍA SOLO UNA PARA PODER DESCRIBIRLA BIEN, Y LUEGO TODAS EN LA SIGUIENTE SECCION PARA DISCUTIR LA CASUÍSTICA
The time structure of the $\gamma$-flash is far from the ideal Dirac delta function.
First, it features a quasi-Gaussian profile with a FWHM of \qty{1.5}{\nano\second}, which will certainly affect the neutron energy resolution (see equation \ref{Eq_Enresolution}).
Then, it also features a tail with a bump at longer ToF values, and a constant background.
This is related to the fact that the buncher is optimized for protons and deuterons, but not for alpha particles.

In the worst case (measurement 1), the tail contains up to \qty{30}{\percent} of the overall $\gamma$-flash, which means that the time of arrival of the alpha beam is not very well determined.
Because of all this, we cannot really treat the $\gamma$-flashes as simple Gaussians when considering their effect in the neutron energy and its resolution.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurements} 
The time-of-flight measurements carried out to study the \Aliso \an reaction took place on April 17th and 18th.
The details of the dates, beam energies, flight path distances and accumulated beam (charge) on target of each experiment are listed in Table \ref{pulsed_measurements_table}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of the time-of-flight experiments carried out.}
\label{pulsed_measurements_table}
\end{table}

The single measurement on the 17th was a test and had a very low current, featuring also the highest tail in its $\gamma$-flash (\qty{30}{\percent} of counts), thus it was discarded in the analysis.
On the other hand, the experiments with the maximum beam energy was repeated at two different distances, in order to assess the expected improvement in neutron energy resolution.

	Their shape will be that of their corresponding alpha pulses, plus a background.}
	\label{uneven_gflash}
\end{figure}

\section{Data analysis}
The objective of our analysis is to obtain the energy spectra of the neutrons generated by the \an reactions.
To that end, we must first separate the gammas from the neutrons by using PSD, creating a Figure such as \ref{example_psd}.
We thus get the gamma flash and the neutron response for each measurement.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{separated_tof.png}
	\caption{Gamma flash (blue) and neutron response (red) for measurement number 2.}
	\label{separated_tof}
\end{figure}

To get the neutron energy spectra, we use two different methods of analysing the resulting histograms for each measurement.

\subsection{Simple method}
This method makes use mostly of the neutron response counts.
We use the gamma flash histogram exclusively to get its center, by taking as the centroid when fitting it to a gaussian.
We then calculate the ToF of each neutron as:
\begin{equation}
	\text{ToF} = t_n-t_\text{flash}+\frac{L}{c}
\end{equation}
with $t_n$ the timestamp (with respect to the signal from the chopper) of the neutron, $t_\text{flash}$ the center of the gamma flash, and $L/c$ the time it takes the gammas to get to the detector, i.e., the ToF of the gamma flash.
From each time-of-flight, we can then get the energy of the neutron as:
\begin{equation}
	E=\frac{1}{2} m_\text{n} \left( \frac{d}{\text{ToF}} \right)^2
\end{equation}
with $m_\text{n}$ the mass of the neutron.

Representing the calculated energy of every count in the neutron response in a histogram, we get the energy spectrum of the detected neutrons.
We correct it by dividing every bin by the detector's efficiency in energy (given by Figure \ref{monster_efficiency}).

To get the result per steradian, we divide by the number of steradians covered by the detector:
\[ \frac{\pi \cdot \text{detector radius}^2}{\cancel{4 \pi} \cdot \text{distance to target}^2}\cdot \cancel{4\pi}\unit{sr}  \]
We further correct it by dividing by the number of alphas (which we get from the current integrator) and the width of the bins.
The resulting plot (Figure \ref{pulsed_energysimple}) is the energy spectrum of the neutrons produced in the \an reactions.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_energysimple.png}
	\caption{Resulting energy spectrum for measurement number 2 using the simple method.}
	\label{pulsed_energysimple}
\end{figure}

This method doesn't consider the shape of the alpha pulse, rather it assumes all of the neutrons are created at the same time, $d/c$ time before the center of the gamma flash.
This means that neutrons of the same energy generated by alphas arriving later will be interpreted as having lower energies, and viceversa.

Also, an excess of neutrons with very long ToF, that are deflected off the walls and take a longer path, will be detected.
This will create an excess of detections of low energy neutrons.
For the results (like Figure \ref{pulsed_energysimple}), we simply remove all counts for which efficiency would be under \qty{15}{\percent}.
A better solution would be to carry out the experiments with a shadow cone, which would absorb neutrons coming from directions other than the target's and allow us to study lower energies.

\subsection{Deconvolution}
We can take the shape of the alpha pulse into account by doing a deconvolution.
This is interesting, as it potentially solves some of the probles caused by the shape of the alpha pulse in the \textit{simple method}.
In order to do so, we fit the neutron response ToF histogram to a function that takes the gamma flash histogram as an input.

We use the gamma flash because, as previously noted, its shape will be the same as that of the alpha pulse, simply scaled by a certain factor and displaced $+L/c$ in the time axis.
This is because, every time an alpha particle hits the target, it will generate $K_\alpha$ gamma rays, a constant.
\\

The function that does the deconvolution holds \num{50} parameters to be adjusted by the fitting, each associated with a certain time-of-flight.
Their values correspond to the number of neutrons of a certain ToF produced per gamma ray detected in the gamma flash.

Their units are equivalent to 'number of neutrons per alpha', but we don't know $K_\alpha$ to convert from gammas to alphas.
If we multiply the parameters by the total number of counts in the gamma flash, and divide by the number of incident alphas, they get units of neutrons per incident alpha:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\text{detected neutrons}}{\text{detected gammas}}\cdot \frac{\text{detected gammas}}{\text{incident alphas}} = \frac{\text{detected neutrons}}{\text{incident alphas}}
\end{equation}
Doing it this way, we don't need to calculate $K_\alpha$, which would involve finding the efficiency of the detector for gammas in order to get the total number of gammas emmited.
After multiplying by that factor, the parameters are independent of the efficiency of the detector to $\gamma$-rays.
\\

Together, they form the neutron energy spectrum of the reaction, but in time-of-flight.
That is, the neutron response that would be generated by a single alpha particle.

If we multiply them by the total number of alphas and plot each parameter at their corresponding ToF, we get Figure \ref{pulsed_deconvolution_delta}, the neutron response that would be generated by a perfectly narrow alpha pulse.
The result is to remove the effect of the width and assymetry of the gamma flash.
We can see that the peaks become higher and more well defined; and the tail, lower.
This is because some of the neutrons detected later are actually faster, but just produced later by the tail of the alpha pulse.
The effect is that they are moved to lower ToFs.

Looking at it the other way around, we could say that the effect of the alpha pulse being wide is that the response to a Dirac delta pulse gets stretched horizontally.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_deconvolution_delta.png}
	\caption{Measured neutron response histogram (blue), result of the fitted deconvolution function (red) and response to a Dirac delta pulse (black) for measurement number 4.}
	\label{pulsed_deconvolution_delta}
\end{figure}

In order to actually get the values of the parameters, we first need to fit the function to the experimental data.

The function is implemented as a C++ functor and the fitting is done by ROOT's \textit{fit} method.
In order for ROOT to be able to adjust the parameters, the function needs to output the neutron response for a given set of 50 parameters, so that it can compare the result to the measured neutron response histogram.

To that end, the function goes through every bin in the gamma flash histogram, which stands in for the alpha pulse.
It multiplies every parameter by the value of the bin, obtaining for each a number of neutrons produced at a different ToF.
It adds together the contribution of all bins, and the result is, if the parameters are right, the measured neutron response.

In order to determine the parameters, ROOT: runs the function, compares the result with the measurements, adjusts the parameters, then repeats; until a solution is found.
\\

This is computationally slow, as it needs to run through that loop many times.
The time it takes grows considerably with the number of parameters, and more than 50 was not considered viable.

In order to get better results when converting from ToF to energy, the parameters are equally spaced in between a minimum and a maximum in the energy space.
This means the parameters are more densely packed for high ToFs and more spaced for lower ToFs.
Because of that, when converting the parameters from ToF to energy, the distances between them in ToF need to be calculated for each, and taken into account.
\\

Converted from ToF to energy, the parameters will form the energy spectra of neutrons generated by a Dirac delta alpha pulse.
Once corrected by the efficiency of the detector using Figure \ref{monster_efficiency}, we get Figure \ref{pulsed_deconvolution}.
As with the \textit{simple method}, we have removed all counts for which MONSTER's efficiency would be under \qty{15}{\percent}.
The problem of scattered neutrons is inherent to the measurements and not due to the alpha pulse shape, so the deconvolution does nothing to alleviate it.

\end{figure}

Figure \ref{pulsed_deconvolution} is the equivalent of \ref{pulsed_energysimple}, with the effects caused by the shape of the alpha pulse removed.
Both are plotted together in Figure \ref{pulsed_5mev}.

\section{Results}
Both the simple method and the deconvolution agree with each other quite well for all measurements, with expected differences:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The deconvolution effectively moves some of the lower energy counts in the simple method spectra to higher energies, as they were created in the tail of the alpha pulses.
		Because of this, the deconvolution spectra are lower than the simple method's for low energies, and higher for higher energies.
	\item The deconvolution seems to only sometimes achieve better definition, which can be seen in the sharper peaks in the spectra.
		This is could in theory be improved with more parameters, but we run into problems with computing time and overfitting to noise.
\end{itemize}

EXFOR data to compare to only exists for the \qty{5.5}{\MeV} thick target yield spectrum.
We can see that the deconvolution matches quite well, while the simple method overestimates it, specially for low energies (Figure \ref{pulsed_5mev}).
This is expected, because of the simple method taking neutrons with longer trajectories as having lower energies.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_5mev.png}
	\caption{Neutron spectra for \qty{5500}{\keV}.
	EXFOR data (black), simple method (blue histogram) and deconvolution (blue squares).}
	\label{pulsed_5mev}
\end{figure}

The error bars shown for the deconvolution are those automatically calculated by ROOT when doing the fitting.
Calculating the uncertainty of a deconvolution method is complicated, and the good agreement with EXFOR shows that it is an improvement over the simple method.
The fact that the error bars mostly cover EXFOR indicates that they are a reasonable enough estimate of uncertainty for showing where the true values might be at higher energies (where we have no data to compare to).
\\

Because of the high amount of noise, we are ignoring all neutrons for which the detector's efficiency would be under \qty{15}{\percent}.
This means that we cannot see the structure under \qty{1000}{\keV} reported by EXFOR.
In order to study the low energy part of neutron spectra at CNA, we would require a shadow cone, or some other means of removing scattered neutrons.
\\

For higher \an energies, there is no data to compare to.
However, we can calculate the maximum possible energy for neutrons, given the Q of the reaction and the cinematics.
We can see (Figure \ref{pulsed_results}) that that energy is surpassed in all cases, by several hundreds of \unit{\keV}.
This is probably because of the limited resolution of the detector.

We can compare both measurements at \qty{8.5}{\MeV} and see that, for lower energies, the higher distance seems to have improved the resolution: the peak at around \qty{1800}{\keV} is higher and narrower.
For the energy limt, it does not seem to have had any effect whatsoever.
However, there are no points to compare after the limit: the first parameter goes to 0 in both cases.
Thus, there could be an improvement and we wouldn't see it.

Comparing their \textit{simple method} histograms, the measurement at higher energies is consistently higher, probably due to a higher percentage of the counts being noise.
\\

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_results.png}
	\caption{EXFOR data (black) and results for all of the time-of-flight measurements.
	The histograms are the simple method, the connected squares are the results of deconvolution, and the vertical dotted lines are the theoretical maximum neutron energies.}
	\label{pulsed_results}
\end{figure}

The sudden increase of cross section near the lower energy cutoff for all measurements is probably not due to a structure in the neutron spectra, but to an excess of scattered neutrons that.
Raising the cutoff further would remove them, but deprive us of a large part of the spectra.
\\

In summary, the deconvolution succeeds in moving low energy counts created by the tail of the alpha pulses to high energies, but only somewhat seems to improve the energy definition of the experiment.
The low energy part of the spectra cannot be seen due to noise, but it could be reduced with a shadow cone or other such system.
Where we can compare, the deconvolution measurements agree well with EXFOR, while the \textit{simple method} ones overestimate.

\chapter{Conclusions}
\section{Thick target yield}
For the \Aliso\an thick target yield activation measurements, results from the two analysis methods employed agree within \qty{1}{\percent}, meaning we can stick with the more standard \textit{decay} method.
Detectors agree with eachother within \qty{8}{\percent} for April and within \qty{4}{\percent} for February, with one detector (LaBr1 and LaBr2, respectively) being consistently higher than the other.
This tells us there is a systematic error when dealing with multiple detectors, that changes when repeating measurements.

When comparing measurements of the same energy in different months the agreement is good, within around \qty{3}{\percent}, which tells us the results are consistent with each other.
The comparison with the literature, however, shows a large disagreement, with our results being higher by a factor of approximately \num{1.9}, a systematic error.
Because the shape shown by our data matches the one of the literature, the error must be a multiplicative factor, and most likely an error in the data analysis that remains undiscovered.

To solve this problem, the data analysis must either be checked for errors in the code (again) or redone from scratch.
If the error still cannot be found, repeating the measurements could be warranted.
\\

\section{Neutron energy spectra}
For the \Aliso\an neutron energy spectra measurements through time-of-flight, the deconvolution results show good agreement with the previous measurement in the literature, and an improvement over the more straightforward, \textit{simple method}.
However, such data to compare to exists only for the lowest \an energy measured, \qty{5.5}{\MeV}.

The deconvolution succeeds in correcting for the long tail and other assymetries in the $\alpha$ pulses created by the accelerator, but doesn't improve the energy resolution much.
Increasing the distance of the MONSTER detector from 1 to \qty{2}{\m} also does not improve resolution by a lot, and is probably not worth the decreased statistics.
\\

Due to the large background of scattered neutrons, the low energy part of the spectra (under approximately \qty{1000}{\keV}) has a large excess of counts and cannot be properly measured.
A clear improvement would be to do following measurements with a shadow cone, able to absorb scattered neutrons coming from directions other than the target's.

\section{Viability of an measurements at CNA/HiSPANoS}
The results show that measurement of \an reactions are viable with the CNA accelerator.
Activation measurements are in good agreement with each other, and if the systematic error can be found, could be done at more energies and for other materials without any changes to the procedure or equipment.

For time-of-flight measurements, a shadow cone or other system for eliminating scattered neutrons is necessary in order to be able to measure the lower energy parts of spectra.
As for the assymetry of the pulses, results could be improved with either a more sofisticated deconvolution system or by adapting the accelerator to better support $\alpha$ particles.
However, the setup is able to give reasonable measurements as-is by using a very simple deconvolution process.
