\chapter{Introduction and motivation}
In \an nuclear reactions, an alpha particle ($^4_2\text{He}^{2+}$) hits a target nucleus ($^\text{A}_\text{Z}\text{X}$) and a neutron is ejected.
Generally, in the laboratory frame of reference, the $\alpha$ is fast-moving and the target is stationary.
The produced neutron will also be fast, and the resulting nucleus ($^{\text{A}+3}_{\text{Z}+2}\text{Y}$) will be of a new element and have a small recoil.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{anreaction.png}
	\caption{Illustration of an \an reaction.}
	\label{anreaction}
\end{figure}

Underground experiments trying to detect dark matter WIMPs or other rare events have to deal with neutron backgrounds that are hard to distinguish from the desired particles.
The main contribution to this background comes from \an reactions, produced by alphas coming from the radioactive decay of elements in the ground.\cite{neutron_in_an}.	%TBD:citas más relevantes, ésta lo da por sabido

A good knowledge of the cross-section and neutron spectra of these reactions is thus useful to differentiate between background counts and rare events.
\\

·Actual state of \an measurements.\\

·The objective of the measurements at CNA are to check the viability for carrying out more \an measurements.\\


\chapter{Experimental setup}
The source of alphas for the experiment is the \qty{3}{\mega\volt} tandem accelerator at CNA, which fires alphas at a \Aliso target.
Detectors used are both organic and inorganic scintillators.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{overview_photo.jpg}

\end{figure}

\section{Tandem 3MV accelerator}
A tandem is a type of linear particle accelerator whose main characteristic is that particles are accelerated twice by the same terminal voltage.
Particles are injected with negative charge from a source situated outside the tank, and accelerated toward the terminal.

Once the negatively charged particles arrive a the terminal, their electrons are removed by a gas, called the \textit{stripper}.
Now with a positive charge, they are accelerated the rest of the way by the same voltage.
\\

In the case of alpha particles, they are injected with charge -1, and then stripped of all electrons, to charge +2.
Given that the maximum voltage of the CNA tandem accelerator is \qty{3}{\mega\volt}, alphas can be accelerated to a maximum of $3\cdot\left(1+2\right) = \qty{9}{\mega\eV}$.	%TBD:añadir injection energy
\\

\subsection{Pulsed beam mode}
For most applications, the accelerator generates a continuous stream of particles.
But it can also be operated in a \textit{pulsed beam} manner, where particles are emitted in groups, or \textit{pulses}.

Ideally, those pulses are instantaneous: all particles arrive at exactly the same time.
In reality, they are approximated by a gaussian distribution, with a certain width in the order of a few nanoseconds.	%TBD: anchura exacta?
\\

To achieve pulsed operations, the accelerator uses two devices: the \textit{chopper} and the \textit{buncher}.
The \textit{chopper} generates an electric field that deflects all particles coming from the accelerator.
With a X frequency, it disengages the field and lets particles pass for X time.	%TBD: poner valores

After the chopper, the \textit{buncher} uses further electric fields to slow down the faster particles and accelerates the slower ones, making the pulse narrower in time (X) and gaussian shaped.	%TBD:poner valor
\\

\subsection{Difficulties with accelerating alpha particles}	%TBD:replace with bold symbol
Although it is used in this experiment to accelerate alphas, the CNA Tandem accelerator was not designed with them in mind.
Rather, it was designed to accelerate deuterons, which have the same mass-to-charge ratio.
This means that, while alphas can be also be accelerated, some problems arise when generating pulses.

The reason is that the electric fields used by the buncher to shape pulses are not strong enough.
This produces both wider and asymmetric pulses than with deuterons, as well as smaller overall currents; especially at higher energies (figure \ref{uneven_gflash}).
\\

·Explain the different parts of the neutron line. Photos.\\

\section{Target}
The target is a sheet of \qty{95}{\percent} purity \Aliso.	%TBD:confirmar porcentaje
This metal was chosen because it is relatively well known compared to others, with the best available measurements of \an reactions to compare to.
\\

Because the target is thick (more than a few micrometers), all of the alphas will be completely stopped by it.
This means that, for some of the \an reactions, the alpha particles will have lost part of their energy in the material.

Any measurements taken with a thick target are thus integrated measurements, for energies up to the one the alphas were accelerated to.
If we wanted to measure only \an reactions at a specific energy, we would have to use a very thin sheet of aluminium, so as to stop the alphas from being slowed down.
\\

It is important, in order to obtain quantitative results, to know how many alphas hit the target.
Because they are stripped of all their electrons, they have charge +2 when they arrive at the target.\footnote{Because the neutron line is aligned with the accelerator, using the \qty{90}{\degree} electromagnet to eliminate other charge states is not possible. Nontheless, the number of alpha particles with charge +1 is considered small enough as to be ignored.}
The target is not grounded, and so it charges up positively as alphas impact it.
By measuring the charge on the target, we can know how many alphas have hit it.

To do so, we connect the target via a copper wire to a \emph{charge integrator}, a device that emits a pulse and discharges the target each time it reaches \qty{0.1}{\nano\coulomb}, or approximately \num{3E8} alphas.
It is important that the target does not accumulate too much positive charge, as that could slow down or deflect incoming particles.

\section{Radiation detectors}
The thick target yield (number of \an reactions per number of incident alphas) will be measured by using gamma detectors, while the \an neutron spectra will be done via time of flight measurements with a neutron detector.
\\

\end{table}

\subsection{LaBr}
To measure gammas, we use two LaBr\textsubscript{3} (lanthanum bromide) detectors, which we refer to as "LaBr1" and "LaBr2".
They are inorganic scitillators, meaning they produce light when hit by ionizing radiation.
This can be used to detect gamma rays by the following process:

When a gamma ray hits the material, it gives all of its energy via the photoelectric effect, or part of it through Compton scattering; to an electron in the medium.
This electron travels the scintillator, losing energy by exciting atoms.
When those excited states decay, they emit a \textit{scintillating} light, to which the material is transparent.

This \textit{scintillating} light is directed to a photocathode, where it emits electrons via the photoelectric effect.
These \textit{photo-electrons} are multiplied in a \textit{photomultiplier tube} (PMT), and finally turned into an electric pulse, which is registered as a detection.

Because proportionality is maintained in each of those conversions, we get a spectroscopic response, where more energetic gammas generate proportionately bigger pulses.
\\

To calculate the detectors' efficiency to \qty{511}{\keV} gammas, we use a \Na source that we stick on the target, at the end of the neutron line.
By fitting the resulting peak to a gaussian, we get the number of detected photons per second.
We then divide by the total number of emmited photons (given the source's activity) to get the efficiency.
\begin{equation}
	\text{detector efficiency} = \frac{\text{counts per second}}{\text{total source emissions}}
\end{equation}

	\label{labr_co60_calibration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{MONSTER}
To measure the time of flight of neutrons produced by \an reactions, we use MONSTER, a liquid organic scintillator.
Two smaller, liquid organic TADEO scintillators were also used, but their data has not been analyzed due to their poorer efficiency.
\\

Their operating principle is the similar to that of inorganic scintillators described before, except that the excited stated that emit the \textit{scintillating} light are molecular in nature, not atomic.
Organic scintillators have a higher efficiency when for detecting neutrons than inorganic ones, as neutrons excite the material mostly through $\left( \text{n},\text{p}  \right)$ reactions (unlike gamma rays), which have a higher cross-section with hydrogen atoms.

Because the molecules are being excited by different charged particles, different states are populated and scintillating light is emmited with longer half-lifes.
This means that the resulting electric pulse is wider, which allow us to differentiate between pulses caused by photons and those caused by neutrons.
This is called \textit{pulse shape discrimination}, or PSD.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{psd_explanation.png}
	\caption{Illustration of scintillation pulses generated by two different radiation types.}	%TBD:mejor calidad, buscar fuente
	\label{psd_explanation}
\end{figure}

By integrating the charge in a scintillation pulse in two parts, between the initial \textit{fast} rise and the latter \textit{slow} tail, we can calculate a number, PSD:
\begin{equation}
	\text{PSD} = \frac{\text{slow}}{\text{fast}+\text{slow}}	%TBD:check
\end{equation}
that we can use to separate counts corresponding to neutrons from those that correspond to gammas.
At high energies, the \textit{fast} portion saturates, causing the sahpe seen in figure \ref{example_psd}.
This saturation can be caused either by a voltage limit in the detector or by the software in the data acquisition system.

	\caption{2D histogram showing PSD separation between neutrons and gamma rays for a MONSTER measurement.
	The separation line between the two is ahown in black and dotted.}
	\label{example_psd}
\end{figure}

MONSTER's response to photons is different than the lanthanum bromide detectors.
Because it is organic, the cross-section for the photoelectric effect is much smaller; and so photopeaks are not visible, only the Compton continuum is.

%%%	ACTIVATION
%%%

\chapter{Activation}
Two different types of experiments are carried out, \textit{activation} ones to measure thick target yield; and \textit{time-of-flight} ones for neutron spectra.

\section{Procedure}

\subsection{Principle}
\textit{Activation} measurements are a way of measuring the yield of a reaction in a material by measuring the decay of a resulting isotope.
For \an \textit{activation} measurements, the beam is operated in continuous mode, launching a stream of alpha particles of a certain energy, $E_\alpha$.
When the particles hit the target, \an reactions (among others) occur.
Because the target is thick, these reaction will happen at alpha energies equal to or smaller than $E_\alpha$, as the particles lose energy in the target.

The number of \an reactions will be proportional to the number of incident alpha particles, and the proportionality constant is the \textbf{thick target yield}.
This is different from the regular yield, which considers reactions at a single energy.
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{\text{number of \an reactions}}{\text{number of incident alphas}}
	\label{tty_def}
\end{equation}

Because we cannot directly observe the reactions, activation measurements will instead count the number of produced nuclei by measuring their decay radiation.
For that, the reaction must produce an isotope that decays with an appropiately long half-life (not too long nor too short), and emitting radiation that we can easily detect.

The target is to be bombarded for at least a few half-lifes, and then left to decay for several more, while we measure the decay radiation with detectors.
We can calculate the number of produced nuclei, and thus the number of reactions that occured, by analysing the rate of detections of that radiation over time and the rate of incident particles.

\subsection{At CNA}
At the CNA, we use a thick \Aliso target with \qty{95}{\percent} purity.
Each \an reaction creates a single \Piso nuclei, with a \qty{2.498}{\minute} half-life.
We measure its decay to \textsuperscript{30}Si by $\beta +$, emitting \qty{511}{\keV} annihilation gamma-rays with an intensity of \num{1.9971}.\cite{nucleardatasheets}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Piso_decay_scheme.png}
	\caption{\Piso decay scheme.
	From \cite{nucleardatasheets}.}
	\label{Piso_decay_scheme}
\end{figure}

We irradiate the \Aliso target for several half-lifes, then the current in the accelerator is cut.
All the while the number of alphas hitting the target over time is being measured and sent to the DAQ by the current integrator (figure \ref{target_photo}).
The \Piso is then left to decay for several half-lifes.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_activation_energy_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum.
	The energy window used to generate the time histogram (figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}) is shown in red.}
	\label{example_activation_energy_histogram}
\end{figure}

To measure the decay of \Piso nuclei, we use the two Lanthanum Bromide scintillators and look at the \qty{511}{\keV} gamma rays emmited from the target.
Figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram} shows the spectrum of one of the LaBr detectors during an activation measurement.
To represent the time histogram (figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}), we take only the counts whose energy fall inside the energy window shown in figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram}.
The reason there are two peaks, instead of the single \qty{511}{\keV} peak we would expect, is that the high rate of counts during activation changes the gain of the detectors (figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}), shifting the channel the peak corresponds to.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_activation_energytime.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum over time.
	The change in energy channel for the \qty{511}{\keV} peak is labelled in black.}
	\label{example_activation_energytime}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_activation_time_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation time histogram.
	The activation and decay periods are labeled and separated from the rest of the histogram by red lines.
	The approximate size of the \textit{extra background} caused by the alpha stream is also shown.}
	\label{example_activation_time_histogram}
\end{figure}

The time histogram in figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram} shows initial counts before the activation starts, corresponding to decay of \Piso from the previous measurement.
When the activation starts, \num{\approx 11000} counts per bin appear very quickly.
These counts go away as soon as the activation period ends.

We call these counts the \textit{extra background}.
They are proportional to the alpha current, and correspond to gamma rays created by reactions other than \an.
They can also be seen in figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}, as the large number of counts appearing during activation well outside of the \qty{511}{\keV} peak.
They affect the histogram because, even if the emitted gammas are outside of the energy window, their Compton continuum still falls inside.

After activation ends, the counts we get correspond to the decay of the created \Piso nuclei.

\subsection{Measurements}
Activation measurements were carried out in two sessions of two consecutive days, in February and April.
Table \ref{activation_measurements_table} summarises the different measurement conditions.

Because detectors were unmounted in between both sessions, calibration measurements with \Na to determine detector efficiency (for activation measurements) were done for each detector configuration.
However, only one set of calibration measurements were done each month.
This caused problems for the April measurements, as the calibrations were done on the 18\textsuperscript{th}, but one of the detectors was moved closer for number 6, then back the following day.

\end{table}

\section{Data analysis}
We can describe the number of \Piso nuclei in the target, $N$, using the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
	\ddt{N} = P(t) -\lambda N
	\label{activation_diffeq}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant of \Piso and $P(t)$ is the number of \Piso nuclei produced (by \an reactions) per unit of time, and will be proportional to the current of alphas hitting the target.
If expressed in number of alphas per second, the proportionality constant will be the thick target yield of the reaction: the number of \an reactions per incident $\alpha$ particle:
\begin{equation}
	P(t) = \text{\an reactions per unit of time} = \text{thick target yield} \cdot \text{incident alphas per unit of time}
\end{equation}
or, for an activation of duration $\Delta t$:
\begin{equation}
	\int_{\Delta t}P(t) \dif t = \text{total \an reactions} = \text{thick target yield} \cdot \text{total incident alphas}
\end{equation}
and thus:
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} =
	\frac{P(t)}{\text{incident alphas per unit of time}} =
	\frac{\int_{\Delta t}P(t) \dif t}{\text{total incident alphas}}
	\label{tty_fromP}
\end{equation}
\\

Our goal being to get the thick target yield from $P(t)$, what we will actually analyze is the activity of \Piso nuclei as they decay by $\beta +$, which will be $A = \lambda N$.
We don't actually measure the activity directly, but rather the activity times \num{1.99}: the intensity of the \qty{511}{\keV} emission.	%TBD: referencia para intensidad, tipo de decay

In order to do that, we use the two LaBr scintillators to detect \qty{511}{\keV} gamma rays.
Some counts will be noise, corresponding not to \Piso decays, but to the Compton continuum of higher energy emissions either in the environment or due to other reactions caused by the alphas in the target.

We must take into account that, when representing the counts in a histogram, the number shown is dependent on the width of the bins.
This means that, in order to get the activity in decays per second, we must divide the \qty{511}{\keV} counts shown in a histogram by \num{1.99} and by the histogram binwidth.
We must also remove a certain background, which the different fitting methods will determine:
\begin{equation}
	A = \text{\Piso decays per second} = \frac{\text{\qty{511}{\keV} counts per bin}}{\text{binwidth in seconds}\cdot\num{1.99}} - \text{background}
\end{equation}
We use three different methods to get $P(t)$, depending on wether $P(t)$ is considered constant during the activation period or not; and on the part of the histogram being looked at.

\subsection{Decay fit}
After the activation period is over, we are left with a certain number of \Piso nuclei that will decay following a radioactive decay law.
For the \textit{decay} fit, we simply fit this part of the activation histogram to a negative exponential, $A(t) = A\textsubscript{EOA} e^{-\lambda t} + B$ to get the \Piso activity at the end of activation, $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.

The fit also considers a constant background $B$, coming from the environment.

It is implemented using the ROOT \textit{fit} method, with $A$\textsubscript{EOA}, $\lambda$ and $B$ as fit parameters.
The value of the decay constant $\lambda$ is fixed to that of \Piso, and not determined by the fit.
However, it can be unfixed so that ROOT calculates its value, both to make sure that no other isotope is being produced at significant quantities, and as a sanity check.
Because that test was successful, the parameter is fixed to the known value of $\lambda$ and following fits only return two values: the constant background $B$, and the initial activity $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.
\\

We then divide $A$\textsubscript{EOA} by $\lambda$ to get the number of \Piso nuclei at the end of activation, $N$\textsubscript{EOA}.
However $N$\textsubscript{EOA} is not the number of \Piso nuclei created by \an reactions, as some will have decayed during the activation period.
\[ \frac{A_\text{EOA}}{\lambda} = N_\text{EOA} \neq \int_{\Delta t}P(t) \dif t \]

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_decay_fit.png}
	\caption{Example decay fit.}
	\label{example_decay_fit}
\end{figure}

We can solve the differential equation during the activation period analytically by taking $P(t)$ as a constant, $P$.
We get
\[ \ddt{N} = P -\lambda N  \]
and its solution is:
\begin{equation}
	N(t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} + \left(  N_0 - \frac{P}{\lambda}  \right) e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation}
with $N_0$ the initial number of \Piso nuclei, assumed to be \num{0}.
$N$\textsubscript{EOA} will then be equal to:
\[ N\textsubscript{EOA} =N(\Delta t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} - \frac{P}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda \Delta t} = \frac{P}{\lambda} \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)\Longrightarrow A\textsubscript{EOA}=P\left(1-e^{-\lambda\Delta t}\right)\Longrightarrow \]
\begin{equation}
	P = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ the total activation time.
%As $P$ is the number of \Piso created per second, we can get the yield of the reaction by dividing over the number of incident alpha particles per unit of time:
%\begin{equation}
%	\text{yield} = \frac{P}{\text{alphas per second}} = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)}
%\end{equation}
We can now get the thick target yield, according to equation \ref{tty_fromP}, as:
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{P\cdot \Delta t}{\text{total incident alphas}} = \frac{A_\text{EOA}\cdot \Delta t}{\text{total incident alphas} \cdot \left( 1-e^{-\lambda \Delta t}  \right)}
\end{equation}

All that is left is to correct for the efficiency of the detector, and the final formula for the thick target yield is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{A_\text{EOA}\cdot\Delta t}{\text{total incident alphas} \cdot \text{detector efficiency} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right) \cdot 1.99}	%TBD? use symbols instead?
\end{equation}
\\

The advantages for this method are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Only the total number of incident alphas is needed, not information of current over time.
	\item The \textit{extra background} doesn't bother us, as we only care about the counts once activation ends.
	\item It is the standard way to carry out activation measurements.
\end{itemize}
The main disadvantage is that, because it assumes $P(t)$ to be constant, the method won't work if the alpha current is not approximately constant over time.

\subsection{Unified and rise fit}
Instead of taking $P(t)$ as a constant, we can fit either the whole histogram or the activation period (\textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits, respectively) to a function that integrates equation \ref{activation_diffeq} by taking $P(t)$ as proportional to the current step by step.
This is useful because the current is not constant, there are drops and rises in many of the measurements (figure \ref{current_histograms}) and this will make the \textit{decay} fit less precise, as the assumption of constant current is incorrect.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{current_histograms.png}
	\caption{All current histograms, superimposed.
	The one in red corresponds to measurement 4.}
	\label{current_histograms}
\end{figure}

This function also considers a constant background, an initial number of \Piso (from previous activation runs); and a number of counts proportional to the current, which correspond to gamma rays being produced by reactions other than \an.	%TBD:like?

The fit returns the \an yield directly, but in units of number of reactions per \qty{0.1}{\nano\coulomb} per binwidth.
Thus the yield, corrected by the detector efficiency, in \an per alpha, is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{\text{fit result}}{2\cdot1.60217646\cdot10^{-9}\cdot 1.99 \cdot \text{detector efficiency}}
\end{equation}
with $2\cdot\num{1.60217646E-9}$ the charge of an alpha particle in tenths of nanocoulombs.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{example_rise_fit.png}
	\caption{Example rise fit.}
	\label{example_rise_fit}
\end{figure}

Data of current over time was not recorded in half of the measurements in April (numbers 8, 9 and 10).	%TBD: por qué razón?
In addition, measurement number 4, in February, shows loss of data due to a problem with the DAQ.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{activation_4_time.png}
	\caption{Activation measurement number 4.}
	\label{activation_4_time}
\end{figure}

These problems prevent the \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits to be used for all measurements.
\\

\section{Results}
Figure \ref{decay_errors_rel_per} shows that the relative difference in measurements between LaBr detectors 1 and 2 is under \qty{10}{\percent}.
The numbers are for decay fit measurements, but are similar for the other methods.
Measurements in February show negative values, indicating detector 2 is higher; while those in April are positive, meaning the opposite is true.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{decay_errors_rel_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between detectors in each measurement.
	The number shown is calculated as $\frac{\text{det}1-\text{det}2}{\left(\text{det}1+\text{det}2\right)/2}\cdot 100$, the difference over the average, in percentage.}
	\label{decay_errors_rel_per}
\end{figure}

The outlier, with \qty{-60}{\percent}, corresponds to measurement number 6.
For this measurement, LaBr detector number 1 was placed much closer to the target, and at \qty{0}{\degree}.
The corresponding \Na calibration measurement may not correspond to that exact configuration, and so the results from this measurement and detector are probably unreliable.
The measurements \emph{before} the change in position can also not be trusted, as the calibration was done on the 18th, after the position change.
\\

The best agreements between detectors are for the measurements in April 18th, under \qty{5}{\percent}.
In figure \ref{decay_errors_per}, we can see that decay fit results are between \qty{10}{\percent} and \qty{5}{\percent} smaller than EXFOR data for the measurements in April 18th, but more than \qty{50}{\percent} smaller for February.
The April 17th results are around \qty{30}{\percent}, and the \textit{outlier} from before is at \qty{60}{\percent}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{decay_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{decay} fit measurement and EXFOR.}
	\label{decay_errors_per}
\end{figure}

In short, \textit{decay} fit thick target yield results agree relatively well with EXFOR data only for the measurements done in April 18th.
The ones done in April 17th are suspect, and the ones in February agree with each other (have the same shape as the EXFOR data) but are off by a factor of $\approx 2$.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_decay.png}
	\caption{Decay fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_decay}
\end{figure}

We can compare this with the results obtained with \textit{rise} and \textit{unified} fits, in figures \ref{rise_errors_per} and \ref{unified_errors_per}.
Both also show February results as smaller than April, but the difference is much smaller.
Because of the missing current data, however, fewer points exist for April.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{rise_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{rise} fit measurement and EXFOR.}
	\label{rise_errors_per}
\end{figure}

For the \textit{rise} fits, there are no points for April 18th, as the only measurement on the 18th with current data has a few extra counts outside the activation period, throwing off the algorithm that determines the exact start and end of the activation period.
Both February and April show, however, similar differences with respect to EXFOR data: around \qty{-15}{\percent} for February and around \qty{+20}{\percent} for April 17th.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_rise.png}
	\caption{Rise fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_rise}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{unified_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{unified} fit measurement and EXFOR.
	\textit{Outlier} measurement (LaBr1, measurement 6) at \qty{-60}{\percent} is not shown.}
	\label{unified_errors_per}
\end{figure}

For the \textit{unified} fits, errors are larger for February, but there is less difference than in the case of the \textit{decay} fits.
They are around \qty{10}{\percent} for April and \qty{20}{\percent} for February.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_unified.png}
	\caption{Unified fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_unified}
\end{figure}

Putting all of the resulting thick target yields together with EXFOR data, we get figure \ref{reactions_v_energy}.
We see that April 18th \textit{decay} measurements agree well with EXFOR data, with \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} measurements have a larger error margin, and differ more.
\textit{Decay} February results, however, differ much more from all of the others.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy.png}
	\caption{All activation thick target yield results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy}
\end{figure}

This discrepancy of the \textit{decay} February measurements is unexplained.
If we ignore the February and April 17th \textit{decay} results, the measurements are around \qty{\pm 20}{\percent} of EXFOR.

\chapter{Measuring neutron energy by time-of-flight}

\section{The time-of-flight experiments}
\subsection{The time-of-flight principle} 
The most accurate. and sometimes the only, method for determining the kinetic energy energy of a neutron is by time-of-flight.
This method requires that the beam of particles producing the neutrons features a pulsed beam structure: the alphas should arrive in narrow pulses spaced with a certain period, producing as a results neutrons also in the form of pulses.
\\

The time that the radiation needs to reach the detector since it is produced is called the \textit{time-of-flight}, or ToF.
In the case of $\gamma$-rays, they move at the speed of light $c$, and thus all arrive at the detector at $\text{ToF}=L/c$, with $L$ the distance to the target, forming the so-called  \textit{gamma flash}.
Neutrons, however, have different speeds depending on their kinetic energy and therefore arrive at the detector with a ToF distribution from which the neutron energy distribution produced by the \an reaction can be extracted.
For each neutron:
\begin{equation}
	E_n = \frac{1}{2}m_nv^2= \left ( \frac{\alpha \cdot L}{\text{ToF}} \right)^2=
	\left (\frac{\alpha \cdot L}{t_n-t_{flash}+L/c} \right)^2
	\label{Eq_ToF2En}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	E_n=\frac{1}{2} m_n \left( \frac{L}{\text{ToF}} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_n \left( \frac{L}{t_n - t_{flash} + L/c} \right)^2
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the distance between the target and the detector, and where the ToF of the neutrons is calculated in reference to the time of the $\gamma$-flash $t_{flash}$ and of the neutron $t_n$ in reference to some other point in time.
In the case that $L$ is expressed in meters and the time in ??, $\alpha$ takes the numerical value 72.29. 

The neutron energy resolution that can be achieved can be calculated through propagation of errors as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Delta E_n}{E_n} =
    \label{Eq_Enresolution}
\end{equation}

Hence, the resolution is better as the detector is placed further from the target and as the beam pulses become narrower (as this is it what causes  $\Delta$t$_{flash}$, the fact the alphas do not arrive all at the same time).
The beam pulses always have a certain width that generally can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution.

In order to study the time structure of the beam pulse, the shape of the observed $\gamma$-flash is a good proxy, because the photons travel all at the same speed and are directly caused by the alphas in the beam.
The gamma-flash will thus have the same shape as the alpha pulse, simply scaled by a factor and with an added background from other sources.

\subsection{Time-of-flight implementation at HISPANOS} 
In order to measure the ToF distribution, each time the accelerator's chopper acts, its internal clock emits an electric signal that is sent through a long cable to the DAQ, which takes it as a reference signal, from wich to determine $t_{flash}$ and $t_n$.
It doesn't correspond to when the pulse arrives at the target, as the time the particles take to cover the distance is not the same as the time taken by the electric signal to travel along the cable and be registered.

The detector signals from photons and neutrons are registered and marked with the timestamp relative to the chopper clock.
The result is a ToF distribution of signals that, in order to have physical meaning, needs just to be shifted so that the $\gamma$-flash falls in the $ToF=L/c$ position.
\\

An example of the observed $\gamma$-flash is displayed in figure \ref{example_gflash}.	%YO ENSEñARÍA SOLO UNA PARA PODER DESCRIBIRLA BIEN, Y LUEGO TODAS EN LA SIGUIENTE SECCION PARA DISCUTIR LA CASUÍSTICA
The time structure of the $\gamma$-flash is far from the ideal Dirac delta function.
First, it features a quasi-Gaussian profile with a FWHM of \qty{1.5}{\nano\second}, which will certainly affect the neutron energy resolution (see equation \ref{Eq_Enresolution}).
Then, it also features a tail with a bump at longer ToF values, and a constant background.
This is related to the fact the buncher is not optimized for protons and deuterons but not for alpha particles.

In the worst case (measurement 1), the tail contains up to \qty{30}{\percent} of the overall $\gamma$-flash, which means that the time of arrival of the alpha beam is not very well determined.
We cannot really treat the $\gamma$-flashes as simple Gaussians when considering their effect in the neutron energy and its resolution.

	\caption{Gamma flash of measurement number 3, in semi-logarithmic scale.}
	\label{example_gflash}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Measurements} 
The time-of-flight measurements carried out to study the \Aliso \an reaction took place on April 17th and 18th.
The details of the dates, beam energies, flight path distances and accumulated beam (charge) on target of each experiment are listed in Table \ref{pulsed_measurements_table}.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of the time-of-flight experiments carried out.}
\label{pulsed_measurements_table}
\end{table}

The single measurement on the 17th was a test and had a very low current, featuring also the highest tail in its $\gamma$-flash (\qty{30}{\percent} of counts), thus it was discarded in the analysis.
On the other hand, the experiments with the maximum beam energy was repeated at two different distances, in order to assess the expected improvement in neutron energy resolution.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{uneven_gflash.png}
	\caption{Superposition of all histograms of gamma flashes.

	It is displaced to the right because of the longer time photons take to travel the distance to the detector.
	Their shape will be that of their corresponding alpha pulses, plus a background.}
	\label{uneven_gflash}
\end{figure}

\section{Data analysis}
First, we separate the gammas from the neutrons by using PSD.
We thus get the gamma flash and the neutron response for each measurement.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{separated_tof.png}
	\caption{Gamma flash (blue) and neutron response (red) for measurement number 2.}
	\label{separated_tof}
\end{figure}

To get the neutron energy spectra, we use two different methods.

\subsection{Simple method}
From each time-of-flight, we can get the energy of the neutron as:
\begin{equation}
	E=\frac{1}{2} m_\text{n} \left( \frac{d}{\text{ToF}} \right)^2
\end{equation}
with $m_\text{n}$ the mass of the neutron.

Representing the calculated energy of every count in the neutron response in a histogram, we get the energy spectrum of the detected neutrons.
We correct it by dividing every bin by the geometric efficiency of the detector and by its efficiency in energy (given by figure \ref{monster_efficiency}).

After dividing by the number of alphas and the width of the bins, the resulting plot is the energy spectrum of the neutrons produced in the \an reactions.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_energysimple.png}
	\caption{Resulting energy spectrum for measurement number 2 using the simple method.}
	\label{pulsed_energysimple}
\end{figure}

This method doesn't consider the shape of the alpha pulse, rather it assumes all of the neutrons are created at the same time, $d/c$ time before the center of the gamma flash.
Also, an excess of neutrons with very long ToF, that bounce off the walls and take a longer path, are detected.
For the results (like figure \ref{pulsed_energysimple}), we simply remove all counts for which efficiency would be under \qty{15}{\percent}.

\subsection{Deconvolution}
We can take the shape of the alpha pulse into account by doing a deconvolution.
In order to do so, we fit the neutron response ToF histogram to a function that takes the gamma flash histogram as an input.

The function holds 50 parameters to be adjusted by the fitting, each associated with a certain time-of-flight.
Their values correspond to the number of neutrons of a certain ToF produced per gamma ray detected in the gamma flash.
The gamma flash is proportional to the alpha pulse, and so if we multiply the parameters by the total number of gammas in the gamma flash, and divide by the number of incident alphas, they get units of number of neutrons per incident alpha:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\text{number of neutrons}}{\text{number of gammas}}\cdot \frac{\text{number of gammas}}{\text{number of alphas}} = \frac{\text{number of neutrons}}{\text{number of alphas}}
\end{equation}

Together, they form the neutron energy spectrum of the reaction, but in time-of-flight.
That is, the neutron response that would be generated by all of the alphas arriving at the same time, over the total number of alphas.

The result is to remove the effect of the width and assymetry of the gamma flash.
\\

The function goes through every bin in the gamma flash histogram, and scales that neutron response by the number of counts in it.
It adds together the contribution of all bins, and the result is, if the parameters are right, the measured neutron response.

In order to determine the parameters, ROOT: runs the function, compares the result with the measurements, adjusts the parameters, then repeats.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_deconvolution_delta.png}
	\caption{Measured neutron response histogram (blue), result of the fitted deconvolution function (red) and parameters (black) for measurement number 4.}
	\label{pulsed_deconvolution_delta}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_deconvolution.png}
	\caption{Parameters resulting from the deconvolution, forming the energy spectrum for measurement number 2.}
	\label{pulsed_deconvolution}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}
Both the simple method and the deconvolution agree with each other:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The deconvolution effectively moves some of the lower energy counts in the simple method spectra to higher energies, as they were created in the tail of the alpha pulses.
		Because of this, the deconvolution spectra are lower than the simple method's for low energies, and higher for higher energies.
	\item The deconvolution seems to only sometimes achieve better definition, which can be seen in the sharper peaks in the spectra.
		This is could in theory be improved with more parameters, but we run into problems with computing time and overfitting to noise.
\end{itemize}

Data to compare to only exists for the \qty{5.5}{\MeV} thick target yield spectrum.
We can see that the deconvolution matches quite well, while the simple method overestimates it, specially for low energies (figure \ref{pulsed_5mev}).
This is expected, because of the simple method taking neutrons with longer trajectories as having lower energies.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.80\textwidth]{pulsed_5mev.png}
	\caption{Neutron spectra for \qty{5500}{\keV}.
	EXFOR data (black), simple method (blue histogram) and deconvolution (blue squares).}
	\label{pulsed_5mev}
\end{figure}

For higher energies, there is no data to compare to.
However, we can calculate the maximum possible energy for neutrons, given the Q of the reaction and the cinematics; and see that that energy is not surpassed.
At \qty{8.5}{\MeV}, we also measured the spectrum at two different distances, and got similar results.

In general however, it is hard to estimate the uncertainty in deconvolution.
The error bars shown in the figures are the ones automatically calculated by the ROOT fitting method.
