\chapter{Introduction and motivation}
In \an nuclear reactions, an alpha particle ($^4_2\text{He}^{2+}$) hits a target nucleus ($^\text{A}_\text{Z}\text{X}$) and a neutron is ejected.
Generally, in the laboratory frame of reference, the $\alpha$ is fast-moving and the target is stationary.
The produced neutron will also be fast, and the resulting nucleus ($^{\text{A}+3}_{\text{Z}+2}\text{Y}$) will be of a new element and have a small recoil.

	\caption{Illustration of an \an reaction.}
	\label{anreaction}
\end{figure}

Underground experiments trying to detect dark matter WIMPs or other rare events have to deal with neutron backgrounds that are hard to distinguish from the desired particles.
The main contribution to this background comes from \an reactions, produced by alphas coming from the radioactive decay of elements in the ground.\cite{neutron_in_an}.	%TBD:citas más relevantes, ésta lo da por sabido

A good knowledge of the cross-section and neutron spectra of these reactions is thus useful to differentiate between background counts and rare events.
\\

·Actual state of \an measurements.\\

·The objective of the measurements at CNA are to check the viability for carrying out more \an measurements.\\


\chapter{Experimental setup}
The source of alphas for the experiment is the \qty{3}{\mega\volt} tandem accelerator at CNA, which fires alphas at a \Aliso target.
Detectors used are both organic and inorganic scintillators.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{overview_photo.jpg}

\end{figure}

\section{Tandem 3MV accelerator}
A tandem is a type of linear particle accelerator whose main characteristic is that particles are accelerated twice by the same terminal voltage.
Particles are injected with negative charge from a source situated outside the tank, and accelerated toward the terminal.

Once the negatively charged particles arrive a the terminal, their electrons are removed by a gas, called the \textit{stripper}.
Now with a positive charge, they are accelerated the rest of the way by the same voltage.
\\

In the case of alpha particles, they are injected with charge -1, and then stripped of all electrons, to charge +2.
Given that the maximum voltage of the CNA tandem accelerator is \qty{3}{\mega\volt}, alphas can be accelerated to a maximum of $3\cdot\left(1+2\right) = \qty{9}{\mega\eV}$.	%TBD:añadir injection energy
\\

\subsection{Pulsed beam mode}
For most applications, the accelerator generates a continuous stream of particles.
But it can also be operated in a \textit{pulsed beam} manner, where particles are emitted in groups, or \textit{pulses}.

Ideally, those pulses are instantaneous: all particles arrive at exactly the same time.
In reality, they are approximated by a gaussian distribution, with a certain width in the order of a few nanoseconds.	%TBD: anchura exacta?
\\

To achieve pulsed operations, the accelerator uses two devices: the \textit{chopper} and the \textit{buncher}.
The \textit{chopper} generates an electric field that deflects all particles coming from the accelerator.
With a X frequency, it disengages the field and lets particles pass for X time.	%TBD: poner valores

After the chopper, the \textit{buncher} uses further electric fields to slow down the faster particles and accelerates the slower ones, making the pulse narrower in time (X) and gaussian shaped.	%TBD:poner valor
\\

\subsection{Difficulties with accelerating alpha particles}	%TBD:replace with bold symbol
Although it is used in this experiment to accelerate alphas, the CNA Tandem accelerator was not designed with them in mind.
Rather, it was designed to accelerate deuterons, which have the same mass-to-charge ratio.
This means that, while alphas can be also be accelerated, some problems arise when generating pulses.

The reason is that the electric fields used by the buncher to shape pulses are not strong enough.
This produces both wider and asymmetric pulses than with deuterons, as well as smaller overall currents; especially at higher energies (figure \ref{uneven_gflash}).
\\

·Explain the different parts of the neutron line. Photos.\\

\section{Target}
The target is a sheet of \qty{95}{\percent} purity \Aliso.	%TBD:confirmar porcentaje
This metal was chosen because it is relatively well known compared to others, with the best available measurements of \an reactions to compare to.
\\

Because the target is thick (more than a few micrometers), all of the alphas will be completely stopped by it.
This means that, for some of the \an reactions, the alpha particles will have lost part of their energy in the material.

Any measurements taken with a thick target are thus integrated measurements, for energies up to the one the alphas were accelerated to.
If we wanted to measure only \an reactions at a specific energy, we would have to use a very thin sheet of aluminium, so as to stop the alphas from being slowed down.
\\

It is important, in order to obtain quantitative results, to know how many alphas hit the target.
Because they are stripped of all their electrons, they have charge +2 when they arrive at the target.\footnote{Because the neutron line is aligned with the accelerator, using the \qty{90}{\degree} electromagnet to eliminate other charge states is not possible. Nontheless, the number of alpha particles with charge +1 is considered small enough as to be ignored.}
The target is not grounded, and so it charges up positively as alphas impact it.
By measuring the charge on the target, we can know how many alphas have hit it.

To do so, we connect the target via a copper wire to a \emph{charge integrator}, a device that emits a pulse and discharges the target each time it reaches \qty{0.1}{\nano\coulomb}, or approximately \num{3E8} alphas.
It is important that the target does not accumulate too much positive charge, as that could slow down or deflect incoming particles.

\section{Radiation detectors}
The thick target yield (number of \an reactions per number of incident alphas) will be measured by using gamma detectors, while the \an neutron spectra will be done via time of flight measurements with a neutron detector.
\\

\end{table}

\subsection{LaBr}
To measure gammas, we use two LaBr\textsubscript{3} (lanthanum bromide) detectors, which we refer to as "LaBr1" and "LaBr2".
They are inorganic scitillators, meaning they produce light when hit by ionizing radiation.
This can be used to detect gamma rays by the following process:

When a gamma ray hits the material, it gives all of its energy via the photoelectric effect, or part of it through Compton scattering; to an electron in the medium.
This electron travels the scintillator, losing energy by exciting atoms.
When those excited states decay, they emit a \textit{scintillating} light, to which the material is transparent.

This \textit{scintillating} light is directed to a photocathode, where it emits electrons via the photoelectric effect.
These \textit{photo-electrons} are multiplied in a \textit{photomultiplier tube} (PMT), and finally turned into an electric pulse, which is registered as a detection.

Because proportionality is maintained in each of those conversions, we get a spectroscopic response, where more energetic gammas generate proportionately bigger pulses.
\\

To calculate the detectors' efficiency to \qty{511}{\keV} gammas, we use a \Na source that we stick on the target, at the end of the neutron line.
By fitting the resulting peak to a gaussian, we get the number of detected photons per second.
We then divide by the total number of emmited photons (given the source's activity) to get the efficiency.
\begin{equation}
	\text{detector efficiency} = \frac{\text{counts per second}}{\text{total source emissions}}
\end{equation}

	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{labr_na22_calibration.png}

	\label{labr_co60_calibration}
\end{figure}

\subsection{MONSTER}
To measure the time of flight of neutrons produced by \an reactions, we use MONSTER, a liquid organic scintillator.
Two smaller, liquid organic TADEO scintillators were also used, but their data has not been analyzed due to their poorer efficiency.
\\

Their operating principle is the similar to that of inorganic scintillators described before, except that the excited stated that emit the \textit{scintillating} light are molecular in nature, not atomic.
Organic scintillators have a higher efficiency when for detecting neutrons than inorganic ones, as neutrons excite the material mostly through $\left( \text{n},\text{p}  \right)$ reactions (unlike gamma rays), which have a higher cross-section with hydrogen atoms.

Because the molecules are being excited by different charged particles, different states are populated and scintillating light is emmited with longer half-lifes.
This means that the resulting electric pulse is wider, which allow us to differentiate between pulses caused by photons and those caused by neutrons.
This is called \textit{pulse shape discrimination}, or PSD.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth]{psd_explanation.png}
	\caption{Illustration of scintillation pulses generated by two different radiation types.}	%TBD:mejor calidad, buscar fuente
	\label{psd_explanation}
\end{figure}

By integrating the charge in a scintillation pulse in two parts, between the initial \textit{fast} rise and the latter \textit{slow} tail, we can calculate a number, PSD:
\begin{equation}
	\text{PSD} = \frac{\text{slow}}{\text{fast}+\text{slow}}	%TBD:check
\end{equation}
that we can use to separate counts corresponding to neutrons from those that correspond to gammas.
At high energies, the \textit{fast} portion saturates, causing the sahpe seen in figure \ref{example_psd}.
This saturation can be caused either by a voltage limit in the detector or by the software in the data acquisition system.

	\caption{2D histogram showing PSD separation between neutrons and gamma rays for a MONSTER measurement.
	The separation line between the two is ahown in black and dotted.}
	\label{example_psd}
\end{figure}

MONSTER's response to photons is different than the lanthanum bromide detectors.
Because it is organic, the cross-section for the photoelectric effect is much smaller; and so photopeaks are not visible, only the Compton continuum is.

%%%	ACTIVATION
%%%

\chapter{Activation}
Two different types of experiments are carried out, \textit{activation} ones to measure thick target yield; and \textit{time-of-flight} ones for neutron spectra.

\section{Procedure}
For the \textit{activation} measurements, the beam is operated in continuous mode, launching a stream of alpha particles of a certain energy, $E_\alpha$.
When the alpha particles hit the target, \an reactions (among others) occur.
Because the target is thick, these reaction will happen at alpha energies equal to or smaller than $E_\alpha$, as the particles lose energy in the target.

The number of \an reactions will be proportional to the number of incident alpha particles, and the proportionality constant is the \textbf{thick target yield}.
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{\text{number of \an reactions}}{\text{number of incident alphas}}
\end{equation}

Each \an reaction creates a \Piso nuclei, with a \qty{2.498}{\minute} half-life.
It decays to \textsuperscript{30}Si by $\beta +$, emitting \qty{511}{\keV} annihilation gamma-rays with an intensity of \num{1.9971}.\cite{nucleardatasheets}

We can thus indirectly measure the number of \an reactions by measuring the number of created \Piso nuclei.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Piso_decay_scheme.png}
	\caption{\Piso decay scheme.
	From \cite{nucleardatasheets}.}
	\label{Piso_decay_scheme}
\end{figure}

The \Aliso target is irradiated for several \Piso half-lifes, then the current is cut.
The \Piso is then left to decay for several half-lifes.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{example_activation_energy_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum.
	The energy window used to generate the time histogram (figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}) is shown in red.}
	\label{example_activation_energy_histogram}
\end{figure}

To measure the decay of \Piso nuclei, we look at the \qty{511}{\keV} gamma rays emmited from the target.
Figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram} shows the spectrum of one of the LaBr detectors during an activation measurement.
To represent the time histogram (figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}), we take only the counts whose energy fall inside the energy window shown in figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram}.
The reason there are two peaks, instead of only one, is that the high rate of counts during activation changes the gain of the detectors (figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}), shifting the channel the peak corresponds to.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{example_activation_energytime.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum over time.

	The activation and decay periods are labeled and separated from the rest of the histogram by red lines.
	The approximate size of the \textit{extra background} caused by the alpha stream is also shown.}
	\label{example_activation_time_histogram}
\end{figure}

The time histogram in figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram} shows initial counts before the activation starts, corresponding to decay of \Piso from the previous measurement.
When the activation starts, \num{\approx 11000} counts per bin appear very quickly.
These counts go away as soon as the activation period ends.

We call these counts the \textit{extra background}.
They are proportional to the alpha current, and correspond to gamma rays created by reactions other than \an.
They can also be seen in figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}, as the large number of counts appearing during activation well outside of the \qty{511}{\keV} peak.
They affect the histogram because, even if the emitted gammas are outside of the energy window, their Compton continuum still falls inside.

After activation ends, we get the counts corresponding to the decay of \Piso nuclei.

\section{Measurements}
Activation measurements were carried out in two sessions of two consecutive days, in February and April.
Table \ref{activation_measurements_table} summarises the different measurement conditions.

Because detectors were unmounted in between both sessions, calibration measurements with \Na to determine detector efficiency (for activation measurements) were done for each detector configuration.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Activation measurements}
\label{activation_measurements_table}
\end{table}

\section{Data analysis}
We can describe the number of \Piso nuclei in the target, $N$, using the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
	\ddt{N} = P(t) -\lambda N
	\label{activation_diffeq}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant of \Piso and $P(t)$ is the number of \Piso nuclei created (by \an reactions) per unit of time.
$P(t)$ will be proportional to the current of alphas hitting the target.
If expressed in number of alphas per second, the proportionality constant will be the thick target yield of the reaction; the number of \an reactions per incident $\alpha$ particle.
\\

In order to get $P(t)$, we analyze the activity of \Piso nuclei as they decay by $\beta +$, which will be $A = \lambda N$.
We don't measure the activity directly, but rather the activity times $1.99$: the intensity of the \qty{511}{\keV} emission.	%TBD: referencia para intensidad, tipo de decay

To do that, we use the two LaBr scintillators to detect \qty{511}{\keV} gamma rays.
Some counts will be noise, corresponding not to \Piso decays, but to the Compton continuum of other emissions either in the environment or due to other reactions caused by the alphas.

Furthermore, when representing the counts in a histogram, the number shown is dependent on the width of the bins.
This means that, in order to get the activity in decays per second, we must divide the counts shown in a histogram by 1.99 and by the histogram binwidth.
\begin{equation}
	A = \text{\Piso decays per second} = \frac{\text{counts per bin}}{\text{binwidth}\cdot\num{1.99}} - \text{background}
\end{equation}
We use three different methods to get $P(t)$, depending on wether $P(t)$ is considered constant during the activation period or not; and on the part of the histogram being looked at.

\subsection{Decay fit}
After the activation period is over, we are left with a certain number of \Piso nuclei that will decay following a radioactive decay law.
For the \textit{decay} fit, we fit this part of the activation histogram to a negative exponential, $A(t) = A\textsubscript{EOA} e^{-\lambda t} + B$ to get the \Piso activity at the end of activation, $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.

The fit also considers a constant background $B$, coming from the environment.
The value of the decay constant $\lambda$ is fixed to that of \Piso, and not determined by the fit.
Thus, the fit returns only two values: the constant background $B$, and the initial activity $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.
\\

We divide $A$\textsubscript{EOA} by $\lambda$ to get the number of \Piso nuclei at the end of activation, $N$\textsubscript{EOA}.
But $N$\textsubscript{EOA} is not the number of \Piso nuclei created by \an reactions, as some decay during the activation period.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{example_decay_fit.png}
	\caption{Example decay fit.}
	\label{example_decay_fit}
\end{figure}

We can solve the differential equation during the activation period analytically by taking $P(t)$ as a constant, $P$.
We get
\[ \ddt{N} = P -\lambda N  \]
and its solution is:
\begin{equation}
	N(t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} + \left(  N_0 - \frac{P}{\lambda}  \right) e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation}
with $N_0$ the initial number of \Piso nuclei, assumed to be \num{0}.
$N$\textsubscript{EOA} will then be equal to:
\[ N\textsubscript{EOA} =N(\Delta t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} - \frac{P}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda \Delta t} = \frac{P}{\lambda} \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)\Longrightarrow A\textsubscript{EOA}=P\left(1-e^{-\lambda\Delta t}\right)\Longrightarrow \]
\begin{equation}
	P = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ the total activation time.
As $P$ is the number of \Piso created per second, we can get the yield of the reaction by dividing over the number of incident alpha particles per unit of time:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{P}{\text{alphas per second}} = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)}
\end{equation}

All that is left is to correct for the efficiency of the detector, and the final formula for the thick target yield is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \text{detector efficiency} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right) \cdot 1.99}	%TBD? use symbols instead?
\end{equation}

\subsection{Unified and rise fit}
Instead of taking $P(t)$ as a constant, we can fit either the whole histogram or the activation period (\textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits, respectively) to a function that integrates equation \ref{activation_diffeq} by taking $P(t)$ as proportional to the current step by step.
This is useful because the current is not constant, there are drops and rises in many of the measurements (figure \ref{current_histograms}) and this will make the \textit{decay} fit less precise, as the assumption of constant current is incorrect.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{current_histograms.png}
	\caption{All current histograms, superimposed.
	The one in red corresponds to measurement 4.}
	\label{current_histograms}
\end{figure}

This function also considers a constant background, an initial number of \Piso (from previous activation runs); and a number of counts proportional to the current, which correspond to gamma rays being produced by reactions other than \an.	%TBD:like?

The fit returns the \an yield directly, but in units of number of reactions per \qty{0.1}{\nano\coulomb} per binwidth.
Thus the yield, corrected by the detector efficiency, in \an per alpha, is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{\text{fit result}}{2\cdot1.60217646\cdot10^{-9}\cdot 1.99 \cdot \text{detector efficiency}}
\end{equation}
with $2\cdot\num{1.60217646E-9}$ the charge of an alpha particle in tenths of nanocoulombs.

\section{Results}
Figure \ref{decay_errors_rel_per} shows that the relative difference in measurements between LaBr detectors 1 and 2 is under \qty{10}{\percent}.
The numbers are for decay fit measurements, but are similar for the other methods.
Measurements in February show negative values, indicating detector 2 is higher; while those in April are positive, meaning the opposite is true.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{decay_errors_rel_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between detectors in each measurement.
	The number shown is calculated as $\frac{\text{det}1-\text{det}2}{\left(\text{det}1+\text{det}2\right)/2}\cdot 100$, the difference over the average, in percentage.}
	\label{decay_errors_rel_per}
\end{figure}

The outlier, with \qty{-60}{\percent}, corresponds to measurement number 6.
For this measurement, LaBr detector number 1 was placed much closer to the target, and at \qty{0}{\degree}.
The corresponding \Na calibration measurement may not correspond to that exact configuration, and so the results from this measurement and detector are probably unreliable.
The measurements \emph{before} the change in position can also not be trusted, as the calibration was done on the 18th, after the position change.
\\

The best agreements between detectors are for the measurements in April 18th, under \qty{5}{\percent}.
In figure \ref{decay_errors_per}, we can see that decay fit results are between \qty{10}{\percent} and \qty{5}{\percent} smaller than EXFOR data for the measurements in April 18th, but more than \qty{50}{\percent} smaller for February.
The April 17th results are around \qty{30}{\percent}, and the \textit{outlier} from before is at \qty{60}{\percent}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{decay_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{decay} fit measurement and EXFOR.}
	\label{decay_errors_per}
\end{figure}

In short, \textit{decay} fit thick target yield results agree relatively well with EXFOR data only for the measurements done in April 18th.
The ones done in April 17th are suspect, and the ones in February agree with each other (have the same shape as the EXFOR data) but are off by a factor of $\approx 2$.

\begin{figure}[H]

	\caption{Decay fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_decay}
\end{figure}

We can compare this with the results obtained with \textit{rise} and \textit{unified} fits, in figures \ref{rise_errors_per} and \ref{unified_errors_per}.
Both also show February results as smaller than April, but the difference is much smaller.
Because of the missing current data, however, fewer points exist for April.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{rise_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{rise} fit measurement and EXFOR.}
	\label{rise_errors_per}
\end{figure}

For the \textit{rise} fits, there are no points for April 18th, as the only measurement on the 18th with current data has a few extra counts outside the activation period, throwing off the algorithm that determines the exact start and end of the activation period.
Both February and April show, however, similar differences with respect to EXFOR data: around \qty{-15}{\percent} for February and around \qty{+20}{\percent} for April 17th.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_rise.png}
	\caption{Rise fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}

\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{unified_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{unified} fit measurement and EXFOR.
	\textit{Outlier} measurement (LaBr1, measurement 6) at \qty{-60}{\percent} is not shown.}
	\label{unified_errors_per}
\end{figure}

For the \textit{unified} fits, errors are larger for February, but there is less difference than in the case of the \textit{decay} fits.
They are around \qty{10}{\percent} for April and \qty{20}{\percent} for February.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_unified.png}
	\caption{Unified fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_unified}
\end{figure}

Putting all of the resulting thick target yields together with EXFOR data, we get figure \ref{reactions_v_energy}.
We see that April 18th \textit{decay} measurements agree well with EXFOR data, with \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} measurements have a larger error margin, and differ more.
\textit{Decay} February results, however, differ much more from all of the others.

	\caption{All activation thick target yield results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy}
\end{figure}

This discrepancy of the \textit{decay} February measurements is unexplained.
If we ignore the February and April 17th \textit{decay} results, the measurements are around \qty{\pm 20}{\percent} of EXFOR.

\chapter{Time of flight}

\section{Procedure}
For the time of flight measurements, the beam is operated in pulsed mode.
This means that, ideally, alphas arrive all at the same time, in groups, spaced with a certain frequency.	%TBD: especificar anchura, frecuencia.
Because of that, all of the \an reactions occur, and all of the neutrons are produced, in pulses.

The time radiation takes to get to the detector since it is produced is called the \textit{time-of-flight}, or ToF.
\\

Both gammas and neutrons are produced at the same time by the \an reactions.	%TBD:mirar tiempo de producción de gammas
Gamma rays move at the speed of light, and thus all arrive at the detector $d/c$ time later, with $d$ the distance to the target.
This is called the \textit{gamma flash}.

Neutrons, however, have different speeds depending on their energy, and arrive at the detector different amounts of time later.
We call the resulting continuum of neutrons the \textit{neutron response}.
\\

\subsubsection{Pulse shape}
In practice, alphas do not arrive all at the same time: the pulses always have a certain width.
Generally, the time the particles hit the target can be approximated by a gaussian distribution.
This introduces uncertainty in the ToF, and thus energy, measurements.

The width and shape of the alpha pulses will be the same as that of the gamma flash.
This is because the photons travel all at the same speed, and because we assume that the production of gammas is the same for all alphas in a pulse.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{uneven_gflash.png}
	\caption{Superposition of all histograms of gamma flashes.
	In red is a measurement taken at double the distance than the others.
	It is displaced to the right because of the longer time photons take to travel the distance to the detector.
	Their shape will be that of their corresponding alpha pulses, plus a background.}
	\label{uneven_gflash}
\end{figure}

We can see that the pulses are not symmetrical: they have long tails; and some of them, several peaks.
For the worst case, the tail contains \qty{30}{\percent} of the total counts.
This means we cannot treat them as gaussians and the introduced error in ToF as their standard deviation.

\subsubsection{Timing of the pulses}
Each time the accelerator's chopper acts, an electric signal is emitted.	%TBD:chopper o buncher?
This signal is what we use to time every detection in relation to a pulse.
It doesn't correspond to when the pulse arrives at the target, as the time the particles take to cover the distance is not the same as the time taken by the electric signal to travel along the cable and be registered.
Regardless, all of the pulses arrive with the same time delay with respect to their corresponding electric signal from the chopper.

From the timing relative to the signal, we get the time of flight by identifying the center of the gamma flash and knowing that it corresponds to a ToF of $d/c$.
\\

%·Show example ToF plot with and without PSD.\\

\section{Measurements}
Time of flight measurements all took place on April 17th and 18th.
The single measurement done on the 17th had a very low current, and the highest percentage of counts in the gamma flash tail (\qty{30}{\percent}).
This translates to a very low number of neutron detections, making the analysis much harder.
Because of that, we discarded the first measurement, and the results presented are only for measurements 2 to 5.

\end{tabular}

\label{pulsed_measurements_table}
\end{table}

\section{Data analysis}
First, we separate the gammas from the neutrons by using PSD.
We thus get the gamma flash and the neutron response for each measurement.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{xxxx.png}
	\caption{}
	\label{}
\end{figure}

To get the neutron energy spectra, we use two different methods.

\subsection{Simple method}
From each time-of-flight, we can get the energy of the neutron as:
\begin{equation}
	E=\frac{1}{2} m_\text{n} \left( \frac{d}{\text{ToF}} \right)^2
\end{equation}
with $m_\text{n}$ the mass of the neutron.

Representing the calculated energy of every count in the neutron response in a histogram, we get the energy spectrum of the detected neutrons.
We correct it by dividing every bin by the geometric efficiency of the detector and by its efficiency in energy (given by figure \ref{monster_efficiency}).

The resulting histogram is the energy spectrum of the neutrons produced in the \an reactions.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{xxxx.png}
	\caption{Energy spectrum.}
	\label{}
\end{figure}

This method doesn't consider the shape of the alpha pulse, rather it assumes all of the neutrons are created at the same time, $d/c$ time before the center of the gamma flash.

\subsection{Deconvolution}
We can take the shape of the alpha pulse into account by doing a deconvolution.
In order to do so, we fit the neutron response ToF histogram to a function that takes the gamma flash histogram as an input.

The function holds 50 parameters to be adjusted by the fitting, each associated with a certain time-of-flight.
Their values correspond to the number of neutrons of a certain ToF, per gamma ray in the gamma flash.
If we multiply them by the total number of gammas in the gamma flash, and divide by the number of incident alphas, they get units of number of neutrons per incident alpha:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\text{number of neutrons}}{\text{number of gammas}}\cdot \frac{\text{number of gammas}}{\text{number of alphas}} = \frac{\text{number of neutrons}}{\text{number of alphas}}
\end{equation}

Together, they form the neutron energy spectrum of the reaction, but in time-of-flight.
That is, the neutron response that would be generated by all of the alphas arriving at the same time, over the total number of alphas.
\\

The function goes through every bin in the gamma flash histogram, and scales that neutron response by the number of counts in it.
It adds together the contribution of all bins, the result being, if the parameters are right, the measured neutron response.

·We fit the neutron response histogram to a function that takes as input the gamma flash histogram and 50 parameters corresponding to the neutron spectra in time of flight. The function loops through the gamma histogram to add the contribution of each bin.\\
·The result is to remove the effect of the width and assymetry of the gamma flash. Show plot of neutron response+response to delta.\\
