\section{Activation}
Activation measurements were carried out in two sessions of two consecutive days, in February and April.
Table \ref{activation_measurements_table} summarises the different measurement conditions.

Because detectors were unmounted in between both sessions, calibration measurements with \textsuperscript{22}Na to determine detector efficiency (for activation measurements) were done for each detector configuration.

\caption{Activation measurements}
\label{activation_measurements_table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data analysis}
We can describe the number of \Piso nuclei in the target, $N$, using the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
	\ddt{N} = P(t) -\lambda N
	\label{activation_diffeq}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant of \Piso and $P(t)$ is the number of \Piso nuclei created (by \an reactions) per unit of time.
$P(t)$ will be proportional to the current of alphas hitting the target.
If expressed in number of alphas per second, the proportionality constant will be the yield of the reaction; the number of \an reactions per incident $\alpha$ particle.
\\

In order to get $P(t)$, we analyze the activity of \Piso nuclei as they decay by $\beta +$, which will be $A = \lambda N$.
We don't measure the activity directly, but rather the activity times $1.99$: the intensity of the \qty{511}{\keV} emission.	%TBD: referencia para intensidad, tipo de decay
Furthermore, when representing the counts in a histogram, the number shown is dependent on the width of the bins.
This means that, in order to get the activity in decays per second, we must divide the counts shown in a histogram by 1.99 and by the histogram binwidth.
\\

We use three different methods to get $P(t)$, depending on wether $P(t)$ is considered constant during the activation period or not; and on the part of the histogram being looked at.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_activation_time_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation time histogram.
	The \textit{activation} and \textit{decay} periods are labelled and separated from the rest of the histogram by red lines.}
	\label{example_activation_time_histogram}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Decay fit}
After the activation period is over, we are left with a certain number of \Piso nuclei that will decay following a radioactive decay law.
For the \textit{decay} fit, we fit this part of the activation histogram to a negative exponential, $A(t) = A\textsubscript{EOA} e^{-\lambda t}$, (plus a background) to get the \Piso activity at the end of activation, $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.
We divide $A$\textsubscript{EOA} by $\lambda$ to get the number of \Piso nuclei at the end of activation, $N$\textsubscript{EOA}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_decay_fit.png}
	\caption{Example decay fit.}
	\label{example_decay_fit}
\end{figure}

We can solve the differential equation during the activation period analytically by taking $P(t)$ as a constant, $P$.
We get
\[ \ddt{N} = P -\lambda N  \]
and its solution is:
\begin{equation}
	N(t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} + \left(  N_0 - \frac{P}{\lambda}  \right) e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation}
with $N_0$ the initial number of \Piso nuclei, assumed to be \num{0}.
$N$\textsubscript{EOA} will then be equal to:
\[ N\textsubscript{EOA} =N(\Delta t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} - \frac{P}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda \Delta t} = \frac{P}{\lambda} \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)\Longrightarrow A\textsubscript{EOA}=P\left(1-e^{-\lambda\Delta t}\right)\Longrightarrow \]
\begin{equation}
	P = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ the total activation time.
As $P$ is the number of \Piso created per second, we can get the yield of the reaction by dividing over the number of incident alpha particles per unit of time:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{P}{\text{alphas per second}} = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)}
\end{equation}

All that is left is to correct for the efficiency of the detector, and the final formula for the thick target yield is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{\text{fit result}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \text{detector efficiency} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right) \cdot 1.99}	%TBD? use symbols instead?
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Unified and rise fit}
Instead of taking $P(t)$ as a constant, we can fit either the whole histogram or the activation period (\textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits, respectively) to a function that integrates equation \ref{activation_diffeq} by taking $P(t)$ as proportional to the current step by step.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{current_histograms.png}
	\caption{All current histograms, superimposed.
	The one in red corresponds to measurement 4.}
	\label{current_histograms}
\end{figure}

This function also has a constant background, an initial number of \Piso (from previous activation runs); and a number of counts proportional to the current, which correspond to gamma rays being produced by reactions other than \an.	%TBD:like?
·Show fits.\\
The fit returns the \an yield directly, but in units of number of reactions per \qty{0.1}{\nano\Coulomb} per binwidth.
Thus the yield, corrected by the detector efficiency, in \an per alpha, is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{\text{fit result}}{2\cdot1.60217646\cdot10^{-9}\cdot 1.99 \cdot \text{detector efficiency}}
\end{equation}
with $2\cdot\num{1.60217646E-9}$ the charge of an alpha particle in tenths of nanocoulombs.
\\

Data of current over time was not recorded in half of the measurements in April (numbers 8, 9 and 10).	%TBD: por qué razón?
In addition, measurement number 4, in February, shows loss of data due to a problem with the DAQ. ·Show time histogram.
These problems prevent the \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits to be used for all measurements.
\\

·We separate gamma flash and neutron response. Show tof histograms.\\
·Explain deconvolution:\\
·We fit the neutron response histogram to a function that takes as input the gamma flash histogram and 50 parameters corresponding to the neutron spectra in time of flight. The function loops through the gamma histogram to add the contribution of each bin.\\
·The result is to remove the effect of the width and assymetry of the gamma flash. Show plot of neutron response+response to delta.\\

·We convert the resulting parameters from time of flight to energy. Show energy spectra plot.\\
·We correct considering the efficiency of the detector. Show final plot.\\

·We have managed to measure the corresponding neutron energy spectra with X uncertainty/resolution and X agreement with previous measurements.\\
