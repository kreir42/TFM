\section{Procedure}
\subsection{Activation measurements}
For the \textit{activation} measurements, the beam is operated in continuous mode, launching a stream of alpha particles of a certain energy, $E_\alpha$.
When the alpha particles hit the target, \an reactions (among others) occur.
Because the target is thick, these reaction will happen at alpha energies equal to or smaller than $E_\alpha$, as the particles lose energy in the target.

The number of \an reactions will be proportional to the number of incident alpha particles, and the proportionality constant is the \textbf{thick target yield}.
\begin{equation}
	\text{thick target yield} = \frac{\text{number of \an reactions}}{\text{number of incident alphas}}
\end{equation}

Each \an reaction creates a \Piso nuclei, with a \qty{2.498}{\minute} half-life.
It decays to \textsuperscript{30}Si by $\beta +$, emitting \qty{511}{\keV} annihilation gamma-rays with an intensity of \num{1.9971}.\cite{nucleardatasheets}

We can thus indirectly measure the number of \an reactions by measuring the number of created \Piso nuclei.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Piso_decay_scheme.png}
	\caption{\Piso decay scheme.
	From \cite{nucleardatasheets}.}
	\label{Piso_decay_scheme}
\end{figure}

The \Aliso target is irradiated for several \Piso half-lifes, then the current in cut.
The \Piso is then left to decay for several half-lifes.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_activation_energy_histogram.png}
	\caption{Example activation spectrum.
	The energy window used to generate the time histogram (figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}) is shown in red.}
	\label{example_activation_energy_histogram}
\end{figure}

To measure the decay of \Piso nuclei, we look at the \qty{511}{\keV} gamma rays emmited from the target.
Figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram} shows the spectrum of one of the LaBr detectors during an activation measurement.
To represent the time histogram (figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram}), we take only the counts whose energy fall inside the energy window shown in figure \ref{example_activation_energy_histogram}.
The reason there are two peaks, instead of only one, is that the high rate of counts during activation changes the gain of the detectors (figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}).

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_activation_energytime.png}

	The approximate size of the \textit{extra background} caused by the alpha stream is also shown.}
	\label{example_activation_time_histogram}
\end{figure}

The time histogram in figure \ref{example_activation_time_histogram} shows initial counts before the activation starts, corresponding to decay of \Piso from the previous measurement.
When the activation starts, \num{\approx 11000} counts per bin appear very quickly.
These counts go away as soon as the activation period ends.

We call these counts \textit{extra background}.
They are proportional to the alpha current, and correspond to different reactions other than \an.
They can also be seen in figure \ref{example_activation_energytime}, as the large number of counts appearing during activation well outside of the \qty{511}{\keV} peak.

After activation ends, we get counts corresponding to the decay of \Piso nuclei.

\subsection{Time of flight measurements}
·Explain the procedure for pulsed measurements:\\
·Beam is pulsed.\\
·We time the pulses by using a signal from the chopper/buncher.\\	%TBD:chopper o buncher?
·Alphas arrive all at the same time (lie), \an reactions happen.\\
·Both gammas and neutrons are produced at the same time.\\	%TBD:mirar tiempo de producción de gammas
·Gammas move at c, arrive to detectors d/c time later. This is called gamma flash.\\
·Neutrons have different speed depending on energy, arrive with different ToF.\\
·Show example ToF plot with and without PSD.\\

·Alphas do not arrive all at the same time: X nanosecond wide pulses. This introduces uncertainty in the ToF, and thus energy, measurements.\\
·Pulses are not symmetrical: tails, several peaks. This means we cannot treat pulses as gaussians and the introduced error in ToF as their standard deviation. Show graph of uneven gamma flash.\\


\chapter{Measurements, analysis and results}

\section{Activation}
Activation measurements were carried out in two sessions of two consecutive days, in February and April.
Table \ref{activation_measurements_table} summarises the different measurement conditions.

Because detectors were unmounted in between both sessions, calibration measurements with \Na to determine detector efficiency (for activation measurements) were done for each detector configuration.

\end{tabular}
\caption{Activation measurements}
\label{activation_measurements_table}
\end{table}

\subsection{Data analysis}
We can describe the number of \Piso nuclei in the target, $N$, using the differential equation:
\begin{equation}
	\ddt{N} = P(t) -\lambda N
	\label{activation_diffeq}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the decay constant of \Piso and $P(t)$ is the number of \Piso nuclei created (by \an reactions) per unit of time.
$P(t)$ will be proportional to the current of alphas hitting the target.
If expressed in number of alphas per second, the proportionality constant will be the thick target yield of the reaction; the number of \an reactions per incident $\alpha$ particle.
\\

In order to get $P(t)$, we analyze the activity of \Piso nuclei as they decay by $\beta +$, which will be $A = \lambda N$.
We don't measure the activity directly, but rather the activity times $1.99$: the intensity of the \qty{511}{\keV} emission.	%TBD: referencia para intensidad, tipo de decay

To do that, we use the two LaBr scintillators to detect \qty{511}{\keV} gamma rays.
Some counts will be noise, corresponding not to \Piso decays, but to the Compton continuum of other emissions either in the environment or due to other reactions caused by the alphas.

Furthermore, when representing the counts in a histogram, the number shown is dependent on the width of the bins.
This means that, in order to get the activity in decays per second, we must divide the counts shown in a histogram by 1.99 and by the histogram binwidth.
\begin{equation}
	A = \text{\Piso decays per second} = \frac{\text{counts per bin}}{\text{binwidth}\cdot\num{1.99}} - \text{background}
\end{equation}
We use three different methods to get $P(t)$, depending on wether $P(t)$ is considered constant during the activation period or not; and on the part of the histogram being looked at.

\subsubsection{Decay fit}
After the activation period is over, we are left with a certain number of \Piso nuclei that will decay following a radioactive decay law.
For the \textit{decay} fit, we fit this part of the activation histogram to a negative exponential, $A(t) = A\textsubscript{EOA} e^{-\lambda t} + B$ to get the \Piso activity at the end of activation, $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.

The fit also considers a constant background $B$, coming from the environment.
The value of the decay constant $\lambda$ is fixed to that of \Piso, and not determined by the fit.
Thus, the fit returns only two values: the constant background $B$, and the initial activity $A$\textsubscript{EOA}.
\\

We divide $A$\textsubscript{EOA} by $\lambda$ to get the number of \Piso nuclei at the end of activation, $N$\textsubscript{EOA}.
But $N$\textsubscript{EOA} is not the number of \Piso nuclei created by \an reactions, as some decay during the activation period.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_decay_fit.png}
	\caption{Example decay fit.}
	\label{example_decay_fit}
\end{figure}

We can solve the differential equation during the activation period analytically by taking $P(t)$ as a constant, $P$.
We get
\[ \ddt{N} = P -\lambda N  \]
and its solution is:
\begin{equation}
	N(t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} + \left(  N_0 - \frac{P}{\lambda}  \right) e^{-\lambda t}
\end{equation}
with $N_0$ the initial number of \Piso nuclei, assumed to be \num{0}.
$N$\textsubscript{EOA} will then be equal to:
\[ N\textsubscript{EOA} =N(\Delta t) = \frac{P}{\lambda} - \frac{P}{\lambda} e^{-\lambda \Delta t} = \frac{P}{\lambda} \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)\Longrightarrow A\textsubscript{EOA}=P\left(1-e^{-\lambda\Delta t}\right)\Longrightarrow \]
\begin{equation}
	P = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t}}
\end{equation}
with $\Delta t$ the total activation time.
As $P$ is the number of \Piso created per second, we can get the yield of the reaction by dividing over the number of incident alpha particles per unit of time:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{P}{\text{alphas per second}} = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right)}
\end{equation}

All that is left is to correct for the efficiency of the detector, and the final formula for the thick target yield is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{A\textsubscript{EOA}}{\text{alphas per second} \cdot \text{detector efficiency} \cdot \left(1 - e^{-\lambda \Delta t} \right) \cdot 1.99}	%TBD? use symbols instead?
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Unified and rise fit}
Instead of taking $P(t)$ as a constant, we can fit either the whole histogram or the activation period (\textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits, respectively) to a function that integrates equation \ref{activation_diffeq} by taking $P(t)$ as proportional to the current step by step.
This is useful because the current is not constant, there are drops and rises in many of the measurements (figure \ref{current_histograms}) and this will make the \textit{decay} fit less precise, as the assumption of constant current is incorrect.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{current_histograms.png}
	\caption{All current histograms, superimposed.
	The one in red corresponds to measurement 4.}
	\label{current_histograms}
\end{figure}

This function also considers a constant background, an initial number of \Piso (from previous activation runs); and a number of counts proportional to the current, which correspond to gamma rays being produced by reactions other than \an.	%TBD:like?

The fit returns the \an yield directly, but in units of number of reactions per \qty{0.1}{\nano\coulomb} per binwidth.
Thus the yield, corrected by the detector efficiency, in \an per alpha, is:
\begin{equation}
	\text{yield} = \frac{\text{fit result}}{2\cdot1.60217646\cdot10^{-9}\cdot 1.99 \cdot \text{detector efficiency}}
\end{equation}
with $2\cdot\num{1.60217646E-9}$ the charge of an alpha particle in tenths of nanocoulombs.
\\

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_unified_fit.png}
	\caption{Example unified fit.}
	\label{example_unified_fit}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{example_rise_fit.png}
	\caption{Example rise fit.}
	\label{example_rise_fit}
\end{figure}

Data of current over time was not recorded in half of the measurements in April (numbers 8, 9 and 10).	%TBD: por qué razón?
In addition, measurement number 4, in February, shows loss of data due to a problem with the DAQ.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{activation_4_time.png}
	\caption{Activation measurement number 4.}
	\label{activation_4_time}
\end{figure}

These problems prevent the \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} fits to be used for all measurements.
\\

\subsection{Results}
Figure \ref{decay_errors_rel_per} shows that the relative difference in measurements between LaBr detectors 1 and 2 is under \qty{10}{\percent}.
The numbers are for decay fit measurements, but are similar for the other methods.
Measurements in February show negative values, indicating detector 2 is higher; while those in April are positive, meaning the opposite is true.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{decay_errors_rel_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between detectors in each measurement.
	The number shown is calculated as $\frac{\text{det}1-\text{det}2}{\left(\text{det}1+\text{det}2\right)/2}\cdot 100$, the difference over the average, in percentage.}
	\label{decay_errors_rel_per}
\end{figure}

The outlier, with \qty{-60}{\percent}, corresponds to measurement number 6.
For this measurement, LaBr detector number 1 was placed much closer to the target, and at \qty{0}{\degree}.
The corresponding \Na calibration measurement may not correspond to that exact configuration, and so the results from this measurement and detector are probably unreliable.
The measurements \emph{before} the change in position can also not be trusted, as the calibration was done on the 18th, after the position change.
\\

The best agreements between detectors are for the measurements in April 18th, under \qty{5}{\percent}.
In figure \ref{decay_errors_per}, we can see that decay fit results are between \qty{10}{\percent} and \qty{5}{\percent} smaller than EXFOR data for the measurements in April 18th, but more than \qty{50}{\percent} smaller for February.
The April 17th results are around \qty{30}{\percent}, and the \textit{outlier} from before is at \qty{60}{\percent}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{decay_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{decay} fit measurement and EXFOR.}
	\label{decay_errors_per}
\end{figure}

In short, \textit{decay} fit thick target yield results agree relatively well with EXFOR data only for the measurements done in April 18th.
The ones done in April 17th are suspect, and the ones in February agree with each other (have the same shape as the EXFOR data) but are off by a factor of $\approx 2$.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_decay.png}
	\caption{Decay fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_decay}
\end{figure}

We can compare this with the results obtained with \textit{rise} and \textit{unified} fits, in figures \ref{rise_errors_per} and \ref{unified_errors_per}.
Both also show February results as smaller than April, but the difference is much smaller.
Because of the missing current data, however, fewer points exist for April.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{rise_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{rise} fit measurement and EXFOR.}
	\label{rise_errors_per}
\end{figure}

For the \textit{rise} fits, there are no points for April 18th, as the only measurement on the 18th with current data has a few extra counts outside the activation period, throwing off the algorithm that determines the exact start and end of the activation period.
Both February and April show, however, similar differences with respect to EXFOR data: around \qty{-15}{\percent} for February and around \qty{+20}{\percent} for April 17th.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_rise.png}
	\caption{Rise fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_rise}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{unified_errors_per.png}
	\caption{Percentage difference in thick target yield results between each \textit{unified} fit measurement and EXFOR.
	\textit{Outlier} measurement (LaBr1, measurement 6) at \qty{-60}{\percent} is not shown.}
	\label{unified_errors_per}
\end{figure}

For the \textit{unified} fits, errors are larger for February, but there is less difference than in the case of the \textit{decay} fits.
They are around \qty{10}{\percent} for April and \qty{20}{\percent} for February.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy_unified.png}
	\caption{Unified fit results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy_unified}
\end{figure}

Putting all of the resulting thick target yields together with EXFOR data, we get figure \ref{reactions_v_energy}.
We see that April 18th \textit{decay} measurements agree well with EXFOR data, with \textit{unified} and \textit{rise} measurements have a larger error margin, and differ more.
\textit{Decay} February results, however, differ much more from all of the others.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{reactions_v_energy.png}
	\caption{All activation thick target yield results and EXFOR data with a \qty{\pm 10}{\percent} error.}
	\label{reactions_v_energy}
\end{figure}

This discrepancy of the \textit{decay} February measurements is unexplained.
If we ignore the February and April 17th \textit{decay} results, the measurements are around \qty{\pm 20}{\percent} of EXFOR.
